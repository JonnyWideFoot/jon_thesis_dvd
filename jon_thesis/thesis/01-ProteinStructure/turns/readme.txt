TypeII   taken from 1AAC residues 38-41   TurnSeq KVGD
TypeI'   taken from 1cgt residues 293-296 TurnSeq KDGA
TypeI    taken from lCSE resdues  39-42   TurnSeq HPDL
TypeII'  taken from 1BBT residues 19-22   TurnSeq NGHT
TypeVIII taken from 1LZ1 residues 86-90   TurnSeq QDNI




NOTE *****
You still to do TypeVIII from beta.pdf
You still need to make 7 mini-rama plots showing i+1 -> i+2




Figure 8. Stereo plot of ß-hairpins in the protein database with type I', turn, where the hairpin with Asp at position L1 corresponds to the protein 1bmd:290-297 fragment (labelled in green), and the two different rotamers of Asn are shown with the protein 1cgt:157-164 fragment and the 1ddt:450-457 fragment. (Both labelled in pink).



Type I P-turn with glutamic acid at position i +
1. The side-chain Ocl of the glutamic acid residue hydrogen
bonds back to its own main chain, stabilizing the turn.
The residues involved are 129-132 (Asn-Glu-Glu-Ser) in
chain B of superoxide dismutase (Brookhaven code 2SOD
MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991).
[Tainer et al., 19821). The plots




Type VIII 0-turn with asparagine
at position i + 2. The side-chain 061 of
Asn hydrogen bonds to the main chain of
the first residue after the end of the turn
(residue i + 4). The residues involved are
86-90 (Gln-Asp-Asn-Ile) from human lysozyme
(Brookhaven code 1LZ1 [Artymiuk
& Blake, 19811). The plots were
generated using MOLSCRIPT


Type II' &turn with threonine at position i + 3, illustrating
the hydrogen bonding between th0e7 ,a tom of
the threonine residue and the main-chain oxygen of residue
i (small dotted line). The hydrogen bond at the main-chain
oxygen is bifurcated, as it also accepts a hydrogen bond
from the main-chain N-H of the threonine (larger dashed
line). The example is taken from residues 19 to 22 (Asn-Glu-
His-Thr) from chain 2 of foot and mouth disease virus
(Brookhaven code IBBT [Acharya et al., 19891). The plots
were generated using MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991
