\chapter*{Acknowledgements\markboth{Acknowledgements}{Acknowledgements}}

Firstly, I would like to thank Mike Tyka, whom without his constant enthusiasm, abilities and numerous humorous interludes, the software used throughout this work would simply not have been possible or anywhere near as fun to produce.

Secondly, thanks to Allan Brewer for his general encouragement and especially
his help in software algorithm development during this work.

Finally, I would like to thank my supervisors Dr. R. B. Sessions and Prof. A. R. Clarke for their constructive discussions and support throughout the course of my PhD and the MRC for funding the project.
