PISCES can provide lists culled from the entire PDB or from lists of PDB entries or chains provided by the user. The sequence identities are obtained from PSI-BLAST alignments with position-specific substitution matrices derived from the non-redundant protein sequence database. PISCES therefore provides better lists than servers that use BLAST, which is unable to identify many relationships below 40% sequence identity and often overestimates sequence identity by aligning only well-conserved fragments. PDB sequences are updated weekly. PISCES can also cull non-PDB sequences provided by the user as a list of GenBank identifiers, a FASTA format file, or BLAST/PSI-BLAST output.

	abstract = {Motivation: Protein structure classification has been recognized as one of the most important research issues in protein structure analysis. A substantial number of methods for the classification have been proposed, and several databases have been constructed using these methods. Since some proteins with very similar sequences may exhibit structural diversities, we have proposed PDB-REPRDB: a database of representative protein chains from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which strategy of selection is based not only on sequence similarity but also on structural similarity. Forty-eight representative sets whose similarity criteria were predetermined were made available over the World Wide Web (WWW). However, the sets were insufficient in number to satisfy users researching protein structures by various methods.<P></P>Result: We have improved the system for PDB-REPRDB so that the user may obtain a quick selection of representative chains from PDB. The selection of representative chains can be dynamically configured according to the user&#146;s requirement. The WWW interface provides a large degree of freedom in setting parameters, such as cut-off scores of sequence and structural similarity. This paper describes the method we use to classify chains and select the representatives in the system. We also describe the interface used to set the parameters.<P></P>Availability: The system for PDB-REPRDB is available at the PAPIA WWW server (http://www.rwcp.or.jp/papia/).<P></P>Contact: noguchi&#064;trc.rwcp.or.jp<P></P>To whom correspondence should be addressed.<P></P>Present address: Information Processing Systems Department, NKK Corporation, 1-1-2 Marunouchi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100-8202, Japan},

abstract = {The most abundant helix type in proteins is the {alpha}-helix, accounting for about 31% of amino acid secondary structure states, while the 310-helix accounts for about 4%. The {pi}-helix appears to be extremely rare and is considered to be unstable. Existing secondary structure definition methods find very few within the Protein Data Bank. Using an improved {pi}-helix definition algorithm to search a non-redundant subset of high-resolution and well-refined protein structures, we found that almost every tenth protein contained a {pi}-helix. This enabled us to show for the first time that the {pi}-helix has structural parameters that are different from the hypothesized model values. It also has distinctive amino acid preferences and it is conserved within functionally related proteins. Features that may contribute to the stability of the {pi}-helical structure have also been identified. In addition to hydrogen bonds, several other factors contribute to the stability of {pi}-helices. The {pi}-helix may have some functional advantages over other helical structures. Thus, we describe cases where the side chains of functionally important residues at every fourth position within a {pi}-helix could be aligned and brought close together in a way that would not be allowed by any other helix type.

Accurate assignment of the secondary structure elements (SSE) (helix, strand, coil) is an essential step for the analysis and modelling of protein structure. Various methods have been proposed to assign secondary structure. Comparative studies of their results have shown some of their drawbacks, pointing out the difficulties in the task of SSE assignment.  Results: We have designed a new automatic method, named P-SEA, to assign efficiently secondary structure from the sole C{alpha} position. Some advantages of the new algorithm are discussed.

	abstract = {Accurate assignments of secondary structures in proteins are crucial for a useful comparison with theoretical predictions. Three major programs which automatically determine the location of helices and strands are used for this purpose, namely DSSP, P-Curve and Define. Their results have been compared for a non-redundant database of 154 proteins. On a residue per residue basis, the percentage match score is only 63% between the three methods. While these methods agree on the overall number of residues in each of the three states (helix, strand or coil), they differ on the number of helices or strands, thus implying a wide discrepancy in the length of assigned structural elements. Moreover, the length distribution of helices and strands points to the existence of artefacts inherent to each assignment algorithm. To overcome these difficulties a consensus assignment is proposed where each residue is assigned to the state determined by at least two of the three methods. With this assignment the artefacts of each algorithm are attenuated. The residues assigned in the same state by the three methods are better predicted than the others. This assignment will thus be useful for analysing the success rate of prediction methods more accurately.},

Ser, Asn, Thr, and Cys have the highest propensities to exhibit such conformations, and the branched aliphatic residues the lowest. Residues cluster in five regions and there are some trends in the types of residues and their side-chain conformations (chi(1)) occupying these. Majority of the residues are found at the edge of helices and strands and in short loops, and are involved in different types of weak, stabilizing interactions. A structural motif has been identified where a residue in disallowed conformation occurs as the first residue of a short 3(10)-helix. On the basis of the types of neighboring residues, the location in the three-dimensional structure and accessibility, there are similarities with the occurrence of cis peptide bonds in protein structures.},

	abstract = {An analysis of the nature and distribution of disallowed Ramachandran conformations of amino acid residues observed in high resolution protein crystal structures has been carried out. A data set consisting of 110 high resolution, non-homologous, protein crystal structures from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank was examined. The data set consisted of a total of 18,708 non-Gly residues, which were characterized on the basis of their backbone dihedral angles (phi, psi). Residues falling outside the defined broad allowed limits on the Ramachandran map were chosen and the reported B-factor value of the alpha-carbon atom was used to further select well defined disallowed conformations. The conformations of the selected 66 disallowed residues clustered in distinct regions of the Ramachandran map indicating that specific phi, psi angle distortions are preferred under compulsions imposed by local constraints. The distribution of various amino acid residues in the disallowed residue data set showed a predominance of small polar/charged residues, with bulky hydrophobic residues being infrequent. As a further check, for all the 66 cases non-hydrogen van der Waals short contacts in the protein structures were evaluated and compared with the ideal Ala-dipeptide constructed using disallowed dihedral angle (phi, psi) values. The analysis reveals that short contacts are eliminated in most cases by local distortions of bond angles. An analysis of the conformation of the identified disallowed residues in related protein structures reveals instances of conservation of unusual stereochemistry.},

	abstract = {Although relatively rare, the tryptophan residue (Trp), with its large hydrophobic surface, has a unique role in the folded structure and the binding site of many proteins, and its fluorescence properties make it very useful in studying the structures and dynamics of protein molecules in solution. An analysis has been made of its environment and the geometry of its interaction with neighbors using 719 Trp residues in 180 different protein structures. The distribution of the number of partners interacting with the Trp aromatic ring shows a peak at 6 (considering protein residues only) and 8 (including water and substrate molecules also). The means of the solvent-accessible surface areas of the ring show an exponential decrease with the increase in the number of partners; this relationship can be used to assess the efficiency of packing of residues around Trp. Various residues exhibit different propensities of binding the Trp side chain. The aromatic residues, Met and Pro have high values, whereas the smaller and polar-chain residues have weaker propensities. Most of the interactions are with residues far away in sequence, indicating the importance of Trp in stabilizing the tertiary structure. Of all the ring atoms NE1 shows the highest number of interactions, both along the edge (hydrogen bonding) as well as along the face. Various weak but specific interactions, engendering stability to the protein structure, have been identified.},

A superfamily groups together domains of different families which have a common evolutionary ancestor based on structural, functional and sequence data. SUPERFAMILY domain assignments are generated using an expert curated set of profile hidden Markov models. All models and structural assignments are available for browsing and download from http://supfam.org. The web interface includes services such as domain architectures and alignment details for all protein assignments, searchable domain combinations, domain occurrence network visualization, detection of over- or under-represented superfamilies for a given genome by comparison with other genomes, assignment of manually submitted sequences and keyword searches. In this update we describe the SUPERFAMILY database and outline two major developments: (i) incorporation of family level assignments and (ii) a superfamily-level functional annotation. The SUPERFAMILY database can be used for general protein evolution and superfamily-specific studies, genomic annotation, and structural genomics target suggestion and assessment.",

abstract = {Assembling short fragments from known structures has been a widely used approach to construct novel protein structures. To what extent there exist structurally similar fragments in the database of known structures for short fragments of a novel protein is a question that is fundamental to this approach. This work addresses that question for seven-, nine- and 15-residue fragments. For each fragment size, two databases, a query database and a template database of fragments from high-quality protein structures in SCOP20 and SCOP90, respectively, were constructed. For each fragment in the query database, the template database was scanned to find the lowest r.m.s.d. fragment among non-homologous structures. For seven-residue fragments, there is a 99% probability that there exists such a fragment within 0.7 A r.m.s.d. for each loop fragment. For nine-residue fragments there is a 96% probability of a fragment within 1 A r.m.s.d., while for 15-residue fragments there is a 91% probability of a fragment within 2 A r.m.s.d.. These results, which update previous studies, show that there exists sufficient coverage to model even a novel fold using fragments from the Protein Data Bank, as the current database of known structures has increased enormously in the last few years. We have also explored the use of a grid search method for loop homology modeling and make some observations about the use of a grid search compared with a database search for the loop modeling problem.
