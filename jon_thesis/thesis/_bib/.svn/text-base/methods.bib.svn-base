  abstract =     "The application of all-atom force fields (and explicit
                 or implicit solvent models) to protein
                 homology-modeling tasks such as side-chain and loop
                 prediction remains challenging both because of the
                 expense of the individual energy calculations and
                 because of the difficulty of sampling the rugged
                 all-atom energy surface. Here we address this challenge
                 for the problem of loop prediction through the
                 development of numerous new algorithms, with an
                 emphasis on multiscale and hierarchical techniques. As
                 a first step in evaluating the performance of our loop
                 prediction algorithm, we have applied it to the problem
                 of reconstructing loops in native structures; we also
                 explicitly include crystal packing to provide a fair
                 comparison with crystal structures. In brief, large
                 numbers of loops are generated by using a dihedral
                 angle-based buildup procedure followed by iterative
                 cycles of clustering, side-chain optimization, and
                 complete energy minimization of selected loop
                 structures. We evaluate this method by using the
                 largest test set yet used for validation of a loop
                 prediction method, with a total of 833 loops ranging
                 from 4 to 12 residues in length. Average/median
                 backbone root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) to the
                 native structures (superimposing the body of the
                 protein, not the loop itself) are 0.42/0.24 A for 5
                 residue loops, 1.00/0.44 A for 8 residue loops, and
                 2.47/1.83 A for 11 residue loops. Median RMSDs are
                 substantially lower than the averages because of a
                 small number of outliers; the causes of these failures
                 are examined in some detail, and many can be attributed
                 to errors in assignment of protonation states of
                 titratable residues, omission of ligands from the
                 simulation, and, in a few cases, probable errors in the
                 experimentally determined structures. When these
                 obvious problems in the data sets are filtered out,
                 average RMSDs to the native structures improve to 0.43
                 A for 5 residue loops, 0.84 A for 8 residue loops, and
                 1.63 A for 11 residue loops. In the vast majority of
                 cases, the method locates energy minima that are lower
                 than or equal to that of the minimized native loop,
                 thus indicating that sampling rarely limits prediction
                 accuracy. The overall results are, to our knowledge,
                 the best reported to date, and we attribute this
                 success to the combination of an accurate all-atom
                 energy function, efficient methods for loop buildup and
                 side-chain optimization, and, especially for the longer
                 loops, the hierarchical refinement protocol.",

                 been developed to build all-atom loop conformations. In
                 this method, a loop main-chain conformation is
                 generated by sampling main-chain dihedral angles from a
                 restrained varphi/psi set, and the side-chain
                 conformations are built randomly. The CHARMM all-atom
                 force field was used to evaluate the loop
                 conformations. Soft core potentials were used to treat
                 the non-bond interactions, and a designed
                 energy-minimization technique was used to close and
                 optimize the loop conformations. It is shown that the
                 two strategies improve the computational efficiency and
                 the loop-closure rate substantially compared to normal
                 minimization methods. CLOOP was used to construct the

                 from the two independent programs and makes a consensus
                 prediction that must pass a set of rule-based filters.
                 CODA was parameterized and tested on two unrelated

                 The improvement is far more marked for lengths six and

The input is the atomic coordinates of the protein structure in the Protein Data Bank format, and the specification of the starting and ending residues of one or more segments to be modeled, containing no more than 20 residues in total. The output is the coordinates of the non-hydrogen atoms in the modeled segments. A user provides the input to the server via a simple web interface, and receives the output by e-mail. The server relies on the loop modeling routine in MODELLER that predicts the loop conformations by satisfaction of spatial restraints, without relying on a database of known protein structures. For a rapid response, ModLoop runs on a cluster of Linux PC computers.  Availability: The server is freely accessible to academic users at http://salilab.org/modloop

                 prediction, is still one of the major challenges in
                 homology modeling projects. In this article, we
                 developed ranking criteria and selection filters to
                 improve knowledge-based loop predictions. These
                 criteria were developed and optimized for a test data
                 set containing 678 insertions and deletions. The
                 examples are, in principle, predictable from the used
                 loop database with an RMSD < 1 A and represent
                 realistic modeling situations. Four noncorrelated
                 criteria for the selection of fragments are evaluated.
                 A fast prefilter compares the distance between the
                 anchor groups in the template protein with the stems of
                 the fragments. The RMSD of the anchor groups is used
                 for fitting and ranking of the selected loop
                 candidates. After fitting, repulsive close contacts of
                 loop candidates with the template protein are used for
                 filtering, and fragments with backbone torsion angles,
                 which are unfavorable according to a knowledge-based
                 potential, are eliminated. By the combined application
                 of these filter criteria to the test set, it was

                 rank candidate that are between 1.3 and 2.2 A for
                 different loop lengths. Compared to other examples

                 root mean square deviation (RMSD) with respect to the
                 main-chain atoms after local superposition of target
                 loop and predicted loop. Loops of up to nine residues
                 length were modelled with a local RMSD <1 A and those
                 of length up to 14 residues with an accuracy better
                 than 2 A. The results were compared in detail with a
                 thoroughly evaluated and tested ab initio method
                 published recently and additionally with two further
                 methods for a small loop test set. The LIP method
                 produced very good predictions. In particular for
                 longer loops it outperformed other methods.",

  abstract =     "In protein structure prediction, it is often the case
                 that a protein segment must be adjusted to connect two
                 fixed segments. This occurs during loop structure
                 prediction in homology modeling as well as in ab initio
                 structure prediction. Several algorithms for this
                 purpose are based on the inverse Jacobian of the
                 distance constraints with respect to dihedral angle
                 degrees of freedom. These algorithms are sometimes
                 unstable and fail to converge. We present an algorithm
                 developed originally for inverse kinematics
                 applications in robotics. In robotics, an end effector
                 in the form of a robot hand must reach for an object in
                 space by altering adjustable joint angles and arm
                 lengths. In loop prediction, dihedral angles must be
                 adjusted to move the C-terminal residue of a segment to
                 superimpose on a fixed anchor residue in the protein
                 structure. The algorithm, referred to as cyclic
                 coordinate descent or CCD, involves adjusting one
                 dihedral angle at a time to minimize the sum of the
                 squared distances between three backbone atoms of the
                 moving C-terminal anchor and the corresponding atoms in
                 the fixed C-terminal anchor. The result is an equation
                 in one variable for the proposed change in each
                 dihedral. The algorithm proceeds iteratively through
                 all of the adjustable dihedral angles from the
                 N-terminal to the C-terminal end of the loop. CCD is
                 suitable as a component of loop prediction methods that
                 generate large numbers of trial structures. It succeeds
                 in closing loops in a large test set 99.79\% of the
                 time, and fails occasionally only for short, highly
                 extended loops. It is very fast, closing loops of
                 length 8 in 0.037 sec on average.",

                 subsequent averaging over all the low-energy conformers
                 obtained. The averaged conformer fairly represents the
                 entire set of low-energy conformers, root mean square
                 deviation (RMSD) values being from 1.01 A for a
                 4-residue loop to 1.94 A for an 8-residue loop.
                 Three-dimensional (3D) structures for several medium
                 loops (20--30 residues) and for two large loops (54 and

                 computational efficiency and sensitivity to initial
                 loop copy dispersion are analyzed. The multicopy loop
                 modeling method requires approximately 20-50\% of the

                 7-residue loops within flexible proteins are modeled,
                 each multicopy simulation can sample a set of loop

                 procedure; for loops of length 5, this results in an
                 average of 1000 loops and for loops of length 9, the
                 number is about 1500. The required number increases
                 only slowly with loop length, in contrast to the
                 exponential time increase involved in direct searches
                 of the conformational space. The best loops among the
                 large number of candidates can be determined by ranking
                 them with the standard CHARMM non-bonded energy
                 function (without electrostatics) applied to the
                 backbone and C(beta) atoms. The same representation
                 (backbone plus C(beta)) can be used to optimize the
                 loop orientations relative to the rest of the protein
                 by constrained energy minimization. Target loops that
                 have many non-bonded contacts with the protein yield
                 better results so that analysis of the non-bonded
                 contacts of the selected template loops is useful in
                 determining the expected accuracy of a prediction. The
                 method for loop selection and optimization predicted
                 eight (out of 18) loops of up to nine residues to an
                 RMSD better than 1.07 A relative to the crystal
                 structure; for 17 of the 18 loops, one of the three
                 lowest energy template loops had an RMSD of less than
                 1.79 A. The prediction of antibody loops from a
                 database search is more effective than that for
                 non-antibody loops. Provided that they belong to one of
                 the canonical classes, very similar antibody loops are
                 certain to exist in the database. Superposition of the
                 stem residues for antibody loops also results in a
                 better orientation than with arbitrary target loops
                 because the neighboring residues tend to have a more
                 similar beta-strand structure. Two H3 loops (for which
                 no canonical structures have been proposed) were
                 predicted with reasonable accuracy (RMSD of 0.49 A and
                 1.07 A) even though no corresponding antibody loops
                 were in the database.",

                 of loops in proteins and its application to four of the
                 complementarity determining regions [CDRs] in the
                 crystallographically determined structure of MCPC603.
                 The method is based on the generation of a large number
                 of randomly generated conformations for the backbone of
                 the loop being studied, followed by either minimization
                 or molecular dynamics followed by minimization starting
                 from these random structures. The details of the
                 algorithm for the generation of the loops are presented
                 in the first paper in this series (Shenkin et al.
                 [submitted]). The results of minimization and molecular
                 dynamics applied to these loops is presented here. For
                 the two shortest CDRs studied (H1 and L2, which are
                 five and seven amino acids long), minimizations and
                 dynamics simulations which ignore interactions of the
                 loop amino acids beyond the carbon beta replicate the
                 conformation of the crystal structure closely. This
                 suggests that these loops fold independently of
                 sequence variation. For the third CDR (L3, which is
                 nine amino acids), those portions of the CDR near its
                 base which are hydrogen bonded to framework are well
                 replicated by our procedures, but the top of the loop
                 shows significant conformational variability. This
                 variability persists when side chain interactions for
                 the MCPC603 sequence are included. For a fourth CDR
                 (H3, which is 11 amino acids long), new low-energy
                 backbone conformations are found; however, only those
                 which are close to the crystal are compatible with the
                 sequence when side chain interactions are taken into
                 account. Results from minimization and dynamics on
                 single CDRs with all other CDRs removed are presented.
                 These allow us to explore the extent to which
                 individual CDR conformations are determined by
                 interactions with framework only.",

                 finding the ensemble of possible backbone structures of
                 a chain segment of a protein molecule that is
                 geometrically consistent with preceding and following
                 parts of the chain whose structures are given. We
                 reduce this problem of determining the loop
                 conformations of six torsions to finding the real roots
                 of a 16th degree polynomial in one variable, based on
                 the robotics literature on the kinematics of the
                 equivalent rotator linkage in the most general case of
                 oblique rotators. We provide a simple intuitive view
                 and derivation of the polynomial for the case in which
                 each of the three pair of torsional axes has a common
                 point. Our method generalizes previous work on
                 analytical loop closure in that the torsion angles need
                 not be consecutive, and any rigid intervening segments
                 are allowed between the free torsions. Our approach
                 also allows for a small degree of flexibility in the
                 bond angles and the peptide torsion angles; this
                 substantially enlarges the space of solvable
                 configurations as is demonstrated by an application of
                 the method to the modeling of cyclic pentapeptides. We
                 give further applications to two important problems.
                 First, we show that this analytical loop closure
                 algorithm can be efficiently combined with an existing
                 loop-construction algorithm to sample loops longer than
                 three residues. Second, we show that Monte Carlo
                 minimization is made severalfold more efficient by
                 employing the local moves generated by the loop closure
                 algorithm, when applied to the global minimization of
                 an eight-residue loop. Our loop closure algorithm is

                 representation of various models of protein
                 alpha-carbon backbone structure. First, we develop an
                 efficient algorithm for the near optimal fitting of
                 arbitrary lattice and off-lattice models of polypeptide
                 chains to their true X-ray structures. Using this, we
                 show that the relationship between the complexity of a
                 model, taken as the number of possible conformational
                 states per residue, and the simplest measure of
                 accuracy, the root-mean-square deviation from the X-ray
                 structure, is approximately (Accuracy) varies; is
                 directly proportional to (Complexity)-1/2. This
                 relationship is insensitive to the particularities of
                 individual models, i.e. lattice and off-lattice models
                 of the same complexity tend to have similar average
                 root-mean-square deviations, and this also implies that
                 improvements in model accuracy with increasing
                 complexity are very small. However, other measures of
                 model accuracy, such as the preservation of X-ray
                 residue-residue contacts and the alpha-helix, do
                 distinguish among models. In addition, we show that low
                 complexity models, which take into account the uneven
                 distribution of residue conformations in real proteins,
                 can represent X-ray structures as accurately as more
                 complex models, which do not: a selected 6-state model
                 can represent protein structures almost as accurately
                 (1.7 A root-mean-square) as a 17-state lattice model
                 (1.6 A root-mean-square). Finally, we use a novel
                 optimization procedure to generate eight 4-state
                 models, which fit native proteins to an average of 2.4
                 A, and preserve 85\% of native residue-residue

                 folding problem demands that two interrelated problems
                 be simultaneously addressed. Potentials that recognize
                 the native state from the myriad of misfolded
                 conformations are required, and the multiple minima
                 conformational search problem must be solved. A means
                 of partly surmounting both problems is to use reduced
                 protein models and knowledge-based potentials. Such
                 models have been employed to elucidate a number of

  abstract =     "BACKGROUND: The ability to predict the native
                 conformation of a globular protein from its amino-acid
                 sequence is an important unsolved problem of molecular
                 biology. We have previously reported a method in which
                 reduced representations of proteins are folded on a
                 lattice by Monte Carlo simulation, using
                 statistically-derived potentials. When applied to
                 sequences designed to fold into four-helix bundles,
                 this method generated predicted conformations closely
                 resembling the real ones. RESULTS: We now report a
                 hierarchical approach to protein-structure prediction,
                 in which two cycles of the above-mentioned lattice
                 method (the second on a finer lattice) are followed by
                 a full-atom molecular dynamics simulation. The end
                 product of the simulations is thus a full-atom
                 representation of the predicted structure. The
                 application of this procedure to the 60 residue, B
                 domain of staphylococcal protein A predicts a
                 three-helix bundle with a backbone root mean square
                 (rms) deviation of 2.25-3 A from the experimentally
                 determined structure. Further application to a
                 designed, 120 residue monomeric protein, mROP, based on
                 the dimeric ROP protein of Escherichia coli, predicts a
                 left turning, four-helix bundle native state. Although
                 the ultimate assessment of the quality of this
                 prediction awaits the experimental determination of the
                 mROP structure, a comparison of this structure with the
                 set of equivalent residues in the ROP dime- crystal
                 structure indicates that they have a rms deviation of
                 approximately 3.6-4.2 A. CONCLUSION: Thus, for a set of
                 helical proteins that have simple native topologies,
                 the native folds of the proteins can be predicted with
                 reasonable accuracy from their sequences alone. Our
                 approach suggest a direction for future work addressing
                 the protein-folding problem.",

                 Structure Prediction) has monitored the state of the
                 art in modeling protein structure from sequence. During
                 this period, there has been substantial progress in
                 both comparative modeling of structure (using
                 information from an evolutionarily related structural
                 template) and template-free modeling. The quality of
                 comparative models depends on the closeness of the
                 evolutionary relationship on which they are based.
                 Template-free modeling, although still very
                 approximate, now produces topologically near correct
                 models for some small proteins. Current major
                 challenges are refining comparative models so that they
                 match experimental accuracy, obtaining accurate
                 sequence alignments for models based on remote
                 evolutionary relationships, and extending template-free
                 modeling methods so that they produce more accurate

                 designed to find the most probable structure for a
                 sequence given its alignment with related structures.
                 The three-dimensional (3D) model is obtained by
                 optimally satisfying spatial restraints derived from
                 the alignment and expressed as probability density
                 functions (pdfs) for the features restrained. For
                 example, the probabilities for main-chain conformations
                 of a modelled residue may be restrained by its residue
                 type, main-chain conformation of an equivalent residue
                 in a related protein, and the local similarity between
                 the two sequences. Several such pdfs are obtained from
                 the correlations between structural features in 17
                 families of homologous proteins which have been aligned
                 on the basis of their 3D structures. The pdfs restrain
                 C alpha-C alpha distances, main-chain N-O distances,
                 main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles. A smoothing
                 procedure is used in the derivation of these
                 relationships to minimize the problem of a sparse
                 database. The 3D model of a protein is obtained by
                 optimization of the molecular pdf such that the model
                 violates the input restraints as little as possible.
                 The molecular pdf is derived as a combination of pdfs
                 restraining individual spatial features of the whole
                 molecule. The optimization procedure is a variable
                 target function method that applies the conjugate
                 gradients algorithm to positions of all non-hydrogen
                 atoms. The method is automated and is illustrated by

                 always contain a positively charged residue when the
                 other is negatively charged and vice versa.) A
                 correlation-based method was used to measure the
                 compensation found in the four residues at a pair of
                 positions in any two sequences in a multiple alignment.
                 All possible sequence pairings were measured at the
                 pair of positions and the resulting matrix analysed to
                 give a measure of cooperativity among the pairs. The
                 basic method was sufficiently flexible to consider a
                 number of amino acid relatedness models based both on
                 scalar and vectorial properties. Pairs of compensating
                 positions were selected by the method and their mean
                 separation (in a protein of known structure) was
                 compared to both the mean pairwise separation over all

                 The results indicated that, at best, there was a slight

                 based on the analysis of known protein structures. It
                 derives the energy potentials for the atomic
                 interactions of all amino acid residue pairs as a
                 function of the distance between the involved atoms.
                 These potentials are then used to calculate the
                 energies of all conformations that exist in the data
                 base with respect to a given sequence. Then, by using
                 only the most stable conformations, clusters of the
                 most probable conformations for the given sequence are
                 obtained. To discuss the results properly we introduce
                 a new classification of segments based on their
                 conformational stability. Special care is taken to
                 allow for sparse data sets. The use of the method is
                 demonstrated in the discussion of the identical
                 oligopeptide sequences found in different conformations
                 in unrelated proteins. VNTFV, for example, adopts a
                 beta-strand in ribonuclease but it is found in an
                 alpha-helical conformation in erythrocruorin. In the
                 case of VNTFV the ensemble obtained consists of a
                 single cluster of beta-strand conformations, indicating
                 that this may be the preferred conformation for the
                 pentapeptide. When the flanking residues are included
                 in the calculation the hepapeptide P-VNTFV-H
                 (ribonuclease) again yields an ensemble of
                 beta-strands. However, in the ensemble of D-VNTFV-A
                 (erythrocruorin) the major cluster is of alpha-helical
                 type. In the present study we concentrate on the local
                 aspects of protein conformations. However, the theory
                 presented is quite general and not restricted to
                 oligopeptides. We indicate extensions of the approach

                 of the erythropoietic hormone erythropoietin (Epo)
                 which predicts a four alpha-helical bundle motif, in
                 common with other cytokines. In order to test this
                 model, site-directed mutants were prepared by high
                 level transient expression in Cos7 cells and analyzed
                 by a radioimmuno assay and by bioassays utilizing mouse
                 and human Epo-dependent cell lines. Deletions of 5 to 8
                 residues within predicted alpha-helices resulted in the
                 failure of export of the mutant protein from the cell.
                 In contrast, deletions at the NH2 terminus (delta 2-5),
                 the COOH terminus (delta 163-166), or in predicted
                 interhelical loops (AB: delta 32-36, delta 53-57; BC:
                 delta 78-82; CD: delta 111-119) resulted in the export
                 of immunologically detectable Epo muteins that were
                 biologically active. The mutein delta 48-52 could be
                 readily detected by radioimmunoassay but had markedly
                 decreased biological activity. However, replacement of
                 each of these deleted residues by serine resulted in
                 Epo muteins with full biological activity. Replacement
                 of Cys29 and Cys33 by tyrosine residues also resulted
                 in the export of fully active Epo. Therefore, this
                 small disulfide loop is not critical to Epo's stability
                 or function. The properties of the muteins that we

                 evaluation of conformational free energies. The method
                 is based on a procedure that generates a set of
                 conformations, each with its own force-field energy,
                 but adds a term to this energy that favors
                 conformations that are close in structure (have a low
                 rmsd) to other conformations. The sum of the
                 force-field energy and rmsd-dependent term is defined
                 here as the colony energy of a given conformation,
                 because each conformation that is generated is viewed
                 as representing a colony of points. The use of the
                 colony energy tends to select conformations that are
                 located in broad energy basins. The approach is applied
                 to the ab initio prediction of the conformations of all
                 of the loops in a dataset of 135 nonredundant proteins.
                 By using an rmsd from a native criterion based on the
                 superposition of loop stems, the average rmsd of 5-,
                 6-, 7-, and 8-residue long loops is 0.85, 0.92, 1.23,
                 and 1.45 A, respectively. For 8-residue loops, 60 of 61
                 predictions have an rmsd of less than 3.0 A. The use of
                 the colony energy is found to improve significantly the
                 results obtained from the potential function alone.

                 distributions of these angles in refined protein
                 structures. A set of filters based on simple rules that
                 protein structures obey is used to reduce the number of
                 conformations to a manageable total. The most important
                 filters are the maintenance of chain integrity and the

abstract = {Protein structures in the Protein Data Bank provide a wealth of data about the interactions that determine the native states of proteins. Using the probability theory, we derive an atomic distance-dependent statistical potential from a sample of native structures that does not depend on any adjustable parameters (Discrete Optimized Protein Energy, or DOPE). DOPE is based on an improved reference state that corresponds to noninteracting atoms in a homogeneous sphere with the radius dependent on a sample native structure; it thus accounts for the finite and spherical shape of the native structures. The DOPE potential was extracted from a nonredundant set of 1472 crystallographic structures. We tested DOPE and five other scoring functions by the detection of the native state among six multiple target decoy sets, the correlation between the score and model error, and the identification of the most accurate non-native structure in the decoy set. For all decoy sets, DOPE is the best performing function in terms of all criteria, except for a tie in one criterion for one decoy set. To facilitate its use in various applications, such as model assessment, loop modeling, and fitting into cryo-electron microscopy mass density maps combined with comparative protein structure modeling, DOPE was incorporated into the modeling package MODELLER-8.

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Short fragments of proteins are fundamental starting points in various structure prediction applications, such as in fragment based loop modeling methods but also in various full structure build-up procedures. The applicability and performance of these approaches depend on the availability of short fragments in structure databanks.RESULTS:We studied the representation of protein loop fragments up to 14 residues in length. All possible query fragments found in sequence databases (Sequence Space) were clustered and cross referenced with available structural fragments in Protein Data Bank (Structure Space). We found that the expansion of PDB in the last few years resulted in a dense coverage of loop conformational fragments. For each loops of length 8 in the current Sequence Space there is at least one loop in Structure Space with 50% or higher sequence identity. By correlating sequence and structure clusters of loops we found that a 50% sequence identity generally guarantees structural similarity. These percentages of coverage at 50% sequence cutoff drop to 96, 94, 68, 53, 33 and 13% for loops of length 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, respectively. There is not a single loop in the current Sequence Space at any length up to 14 residues that is not matched with a conformational segment that shares at least 20% sequence identity. This minimum observed identity is 40% for loops of 12 residues or shorter and is as high as 50% for 10 residue or shorter loops. We also assessed the impact of rapidly growing sequence databanks on the estimated number of new loop conformations and found that while the number of sequentially unique sequence segments increased about six folds during the last five years there are almost no unique conformational segments among these up to 12 residues long fragments.CONCLUSION:The results suggest that fragment based prediction approaches are not limited any more by the completeness of fragments in databanks but rather by the effective scoring and search algorithms to locate them. The current favorable coverage and trends observed will be further accentuated with the progress of Protein Structure Initiative that targets new protein folds and ultimately aims at providing an exhaustive coverage of the structure space.},

                 connecting regular secondary structures. They are both
                 the most difficult and error prone regions of a protein
                 to solve by X-ray crystallography and the hardest
                 regions to model using knowledge-based procedures.
                 While the core of a protein can be straight forwardly
                 modelled from the structurally conserved regions of
                 homologues of known structure, loops must be modelled
                 from a selected homologue or from a loop chosen from
                 outside the family. Here we present a loop prediction
                 procedure that attempts to identify the conformational
                 class of the loop rather than to select a specific loop
                 from a database of fragments. The structures of some
                 2083 loops of one to eight residues in length were
                 extracted from a database of 225 protein and protein
                 domain structures. For each loop, the relative
                 disposition of its bounding secondary structures is
                 described by the separation between the tips of their
                 axes, the angle and dihedral angle between their axes.
                 From the clustering of the loops according to the root
                 mean square deviation of their spatial fit, a total of
                 162 loop conformational classes, including 79\% of
                 loops, were identified. One-hundred and eight of these,
                 involving 66\% of the loops, were populated by at least
                 four non-homologous loops or four loops sharing a low
                 sequence identity. Another 54 classes, including 13\%
                 of the loops, were populated by at least three loops of
                 low sequence similarity from three or fewer
                 non-homologous groups. Most of the previously described
                 loop conformations were found among the populated
                 classes. For each class a template was constructed
                 containing both sequence preferences and the relative
                 disposition of bounding secondary structures among
                 member loops. During comparative modelling, the
                 conformation of a loop can be predicted by identifying
                 a loop class with which its sequence and disposition of
                 bounding secondary structures are compatible.",

                 a loop can sometimes be modelled from a homologue, very

                 select a specific loop from a set of fragments
                 extracted from known structures or generated ab initio.
                 Templates are constructed for each of the 161 loop
                 conformational classes that have been identified from
                 the clustering of the structures of some 2024 loops of
                 one to eight residues in length. A class template
                 describes both sequence preferences and relative
                 disposition of bounding secondary structures. During
                 comparative modelling, the conformation of a loop can
                 be predicted by identifying a loop class with which its
                 sequence and disposition of bounding secondary
                 structures are compatible. The procedure is tested on
                 an unrelated non-redundant set of 1785 loops under
                 stringent and lax evaluation schemes. Optimal sequence
                 score cut-offs are identified such that the prediction
                 rate is equal to the percentage of loops assigned to
                 acceptable classes. Under the stringent evaluation, at
                 the optimal sequence score cut-off, a conformation is
                 predicted for 50\% of loops of which 47\% are correct,
                 while under the lax evaluation a conformation is
                 predicted for 63\% of loops of which 54\% are correct.
                 Sequence score is shown to be a good indicator of the
                 probability of a prediction being correct. Loop length
                 also has a strong affect on prediction outcomes.
                 Considering only loops of two to five residues in
                 length, under the stringent evaluation 62\% of loops
                 are predicted with 52\% of these predictions being
                 correct while under the lax evaluation predictions are

                 structural genomics initiatives. A large body of
                 evidence suggests that protein structural information
                 is frequently encoded in local sequences, and that
                 folds are mainly made up of a number of simple local
                 units of super-secondary structural motifs, consisting
                 of a few secondary structures and their connecting
                 loops. Moreover, protein loops play an important role
                 in protein function. Here we present ArchDB, a

                 defining the structure of a loop connecting 2 secondary
                 structures. This problem frequently occurs in homology
                 modeling, fold recognition, and in several strategies
                 in ab initio structure prediction. In our previous
                 work, we developed a classification database of
                 structural motifs, ArchDB. The database contains 12,665
                 clustered loops in 451 structural classes with
                 information about phi-psi angles in the loops and 1492
                 structural subclasses with the relative locations of
                 the bracing secondary structures. Here we evaluate the
                 extent to which sequence information in the loop
                 database can be used to predict loop structure. Two
                 sequence profiles were used, a HMM profile and a PSSM
                 derived from PSI-BLAST. A jack-knife test was made
                 removing homologous loops using SCOP superfamily
                 definition and predicting afterwards against
                 recalculated profiles that only take into account the
                 sequence information. Two scenarios were considered:
                 (1) prediction of structural class with application in
                 comparative modeling and (2) prediction of structural
                 subclass with application in fold recognition and ab
                 initio. For the first scenario, structural class
                 prediction was made directly over loops with X-ray
                 secondary structure assignment, and if we consider the
                 top 20 classes out of 451 possible classes, the best
                 accuracy of prediction is 78.5\%. In the second
                 scenario, structural subclass prediction was made over
                 loops using PSI-PRED (Jones, J. Mol. Biol.
                 1999;292:195-202) secondary structure prediction to
                 define loop boundaries, and if we take into account the
                 top 20 subclasses out of 1492, the best accuracy is
                 46.7\%. Accuracy of loop prediction was also evaluated

abstract = {Motivation: Homology or comparative modeling is currently the most accurate method to predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins. It generally consists in four steps: (1) databanks searching to identify the structural homolog, (2) target-template alignment, (3) model building and optimization, and (4) model evaluation. The target-template alignment step is generally accepted as the most critical step in homology modeling.  Results: We present here ESyPred3D, a new automated homology  modeling program. The method gets benefit of the increased alignment performances of a new alignment strategy. Alignments are obtained by combining, weighting and screening the results of several multiple alignment programs. The final three-dimensional structure is build using the modeling package MODELLER. ESyPred3D was tested on 13 targets in the CASP4 experiment (Critical Assessment of Techniques for Proteins Structural Prediction). Our alignment strategy obtains better results compared to PSI-BLAST alignments and ESyPred3D alignments are among the most accurate compared to those of participants having used the same template.

abstract = {SWISS-MODEL (http://swissmodel.expasy.org) is a server for automated comparative modeling of three-dimensional (3D) protein structures. It pioneered the field of automated modeling starting in 1993 and is the most widely-used free web-based automated modeling facility today. In 2002 the server computed 120 000 user requests for 3D protein models. SWISS-MODEL provides several levels of user interaction through its World Wide Web interface: in the  first approach mode' only an amino acid sequence of a protein is submitted to build a 3D model. Template selection, alignment and model building are done completely automated by the server. In the  alignment mode', the modeling process is based on a user-defined target-template alignment. Complex modeling tasks can be handled with the  project mode' using DeepView (Swiss-PdbViewer), an integrated sequence-to-structure workbench. All models are sent back via email with a detailed modeling report. WhatCheck analyses and ANOLEA evaluations are provided optionally. The reliability of SWISS-MODEL is continuously evaluated in the EVA-CM project. The SWISS-MODEL server is under constant development to improve the successful implementation of expert knowledge into an easy-to-use server.

abstract = {3D-Jury is a fully automated protein structure meta prediction system accessible via the Meta Server interface (http://BioInfo.PL/Meta). This is one of the meta predictors, which have made a dramatic, unprecedented impact on the last CASP-5 experiment. The 3D-Jury is comparable with other meta servers but it has the highest combined specificity and sensitivity. The presented method is also very simple and versatile and can be used to create meta predictions even from sets of models produced by humans. An additional and very important and novel feature of the system is the high correlation between the reported confidence score and the accuracy of the model. The number of correctly predicted residues can be estimated directly from the prediction score. The high reliability of the method enables any biologist to submit a target of interest to the Meta Server and screen with relatively high confidence, whether the target can be predicted by fold recognition methods while being unpredictable using standard approaches like PSI-Blast. This can point to interesting relationships which could have been missed in annotations of proteins or genomes and provide very valuable information for novel scientific discoveries.
