                 multiple sequence alignment method has been greatly
                 improved for the alignment of divergent protein
                 sequences. Firstly, individual weights are assigned to
                 each sequence in a partial alignment in order to
                 down-weight near-duplicate sequences and up-weight the
                 most divergent ones. Secondly, amino acid substitution
                 matrices are varied at different alignment stages
                 according to the divergence of the sequences to be
                 aligned. Thirdly, residue-specific gap penalties and
                 locally reduced gap penalties in hydrophilic regions
                 encourage new gaps in potential loop regions rather
                 than regular secondary structure. Fourthly, positions
                 in early alignments where gaps have been opened receive
                 locally reduced gap penalties to encourage the opening
                 up of new gaps at these positions. These modifications
                 are incorporated into a new program, CLUSTAL W which is
                 freely available.",

                 (meta-predictors) have higher accuracy than individual
                 structure prediction algorithms (their components). The
                 goal for the development of the 3D-Jury system is to
                 create a simple but powerful procedure for generating
                 meta-predictions using variable sets of models obtained
                 from diverse sources. The resulting protocol should
                 help to improve the quality of structural annotations
                 of novel proteins. Results: The 3D-Jury system
                 generates meta-predictions from sets of models created
                 using variable methods. It is not necessary to know
                 prior characteristics of the methods. The system is
                 able to utilize immediately new components (additional
                 prediction providers). The accuracy of the system is
                 comparable with other well-tuned prediction servers.
                 The algorithm resembles methods of selecting models
                 generated using ab initio folding simulations. It is
                 simple and offers a portable solution to improve the
                 accuracy of other protein structure prediction
                 protocols. AVAILABILITY: The 3D-Jury system is
                 available via the Structure Prediction Meta Server
                 (http://BioInfo.PL/Meta/) to the academic community.
                 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 3D-Jury is coupled to the
                 continuous online server evaluation program, LiveBench
