  abstract =     "BACKGROUND: Protein evolution gives rise to families
                 of structurally related proteins, within which sequence
                 identities can be extremely low. As a result,
                 structure-based classifications can be effective at
                 identifying unanticipated relationships in known
                 structures and in optimal cases function can also be
                 assigned. The ever increasing number of known protein
                 structures is too large to classify all proteins
                 manually, therefore, automatic methods are needed for
                 fast evaluation of protein structures. RESULTS: We
                 present a semi-automatic procedure for deriving a novel
                 hierarchical classification of protein domain
                 structures (CATH). The four main levels of our
                 classification are protein class (C), architecture (A),
                 topology (T) and homologous superfamily (H). Class is
                 the simplest level, and it essentially describes the
                 secondary structure composition of each domain. In
                 contrast, architecture summarises the shape revealed by
                 the orientations of the secondary structure units, such
                 as barrels and sandwiches. At the topology level,
                 sequential connectivity is considered, such that
                 members of the same architecture might have quite
                 different topologies. When structures belonging to the
                 same T-level have suitably high similarities combined
                 with similar functions, the proteins are assumed to be
                 evolutionarily related and put into the same homologous
                 superfamily. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the structural
                 families generated by CATH reveals the prominent
                 features of protein structure space. We find that
                 nearly a third of the homologous superfamilies
                 (H-levels) belong to ten major T-levels, which we call
                 superfolds, and furthermore that nearly two-thirds of
                 these H-levels cluster into nine simple architectures.
                 A database of well-characterised protein structure
                 families, such as CATH, will facilitate the assignment
                 of structure-function/evolution relationships to both
                 known and newly determined protein structures.",

  abstract =     "Prediction of protein structure from amino-acid
                 sequence still continues to be an unsolved problem of
                 theoretical molecular biology. One approach to solve it
                 is to construct an appropriate (free) energy function
                 that recognizes the native structures of some selected
                 proteins (whose native structures are known) as the
                 ones distinctively lowest in (free) energy and then to
                 carry out a search of the lowest-energy structure of a
                 new protein. In order to reduce the complexity of the
                 problem and the cost of energy evaluation, the
                 so-called united-residue representation of the
                 polypeptide chain is often applied, in which each
                 amino-acid residue is represented by only a few
                 interaction sites. Once the global energy minimum of
                 the simplified chain has been found, the all-atom
                 structure can easily and reliably be constructed. The
                 search of the lowest-energy structure is usually
                 carried out by means of Monte Carlo methods, though use
                 of more efficient global-optimization methods,
                 especially those of deformation of original energy
                 surface is potentially promising. Monte Carlo search of
                 the conformational space can be accelerated greatly, if
                 the chain is superposed on a discrete lattice (the
                 on-lattice approach). On the other hand, the on-lattice
                 approach prohibits the use of many efficient
                 global-optimization methods, because they require both
                 energy and its space derivatives. The on-lattice
                 methods in which the chain is embedded in the
                 continuous 3D space are, therefore, also worth
                 developing. In this paper we summarize the work on the
                 design and implementation of an off-lattice
                 united-residue force field that is underway in our
                 group, in cooperation with Professor HA. Scheraga of

                 inito protein structure prediction. Protein
                 conformation has been modeled by using six optimized
                 backbone torsion angles and fixed side chains
                 approximating rotationally averaged real side chains.
                 The approximations aim to keep complexity of the
                 structure description to a minimum without seriously
                 compromising the accuracy of the structural
                 representation. An evolutionary Monte Carlo algorithm
                 has been developed to search through this restricted
                 conformational space to locate low-energy protein
                 structures. A simple physicochemical force field has
                 been developed to assess the energies of different
                 conformations within this structural description. The
                 corresponding residue interaction energies are based on
                 hydrophobic, hydrophilic, steric, and hydrogen-bonding
                 potentials. The search procedure has been used to
                 locate native energy minima from primary sequence
                 alone. The 3-D structures of polypeptides up to 38
                 residues with both beta and alpha secondary structural
                 elements have been accurately predicted. The search
                 procedure has been found to be highly efficient and
                 follows an energetically and structurally plausible
                 pathway to locate native populations. The simple force
                 field described in the study has been compared with a
                 more complex all-atom model and been found to be

                 chain, with which we can enumerate all possible
                 backbone conformations of small proteins. A protein is
                 represented by a self-avoiding path of connected
                 vertices on a tetrahedral lattice, with several amino
                 acid residues assigned to each lattice vertex. For five
                 small structurally dissimilar proteins, we find that we
                 can separate native-like structures from the vast
                 majority of non-native folds by using only simple
                 structural and energetic criteria. This method
                 demonstrates significant generality and predictive
                 power without requiring foreknowledge of any native
                 structural details.",
