Clearly, the same physics applies in all three cases. The differences in potential energy functions reflect differences in how the calculations are performed. With improvements in computer power and algorithms, the same potential energy function should be applicable to all three problems. In this review, we examine energy functions currently used for protein design, and look to the molecular mechanics field for advances that could be used in the next generation of design algorithms. In particular, we focus on improved models of the hydrophobic effect, polarization and hydrogen bonding.},

	abstract = {Empirical force field-based studies of biological macromolecules are becoming a common tool for investigating their structure-activity relationships at an atomic level of detail. Such studies facilitate interpretation of experimental data and allow for information not readily accessible to experimental methods to be obtained. A large part of the success of empirical force field-based methods is the quality of the force fields combined with the algorithmic advances that allow for more accurate reproduction of experimental observables. Presented is an overview of the issues associated with the development and application of empirical force fields to biomolecular systems. This is followed by a summary of the force fields commonly applied to the different classes of biomolecules; proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates. In addition, issues associated with computational studies on heterogeneous biomolecular systems and the transferability of force fields to a wide range of organic molecules of pharmacological interest are discussed. \© 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract =     "The conformations of loops are determined by the
                 water-mediated interactions between amino acid
                 residues. Energy functions that describe the
                 interactions can be derived either from physical
                 principles (physical-based energy function) or
                 statistical analysis of known protein structures
                 (knowledge-based statistical potentials). It is
                 commonly believed that statistical potentials are
                 appropriate for coarse-grained representation of
                 proteins but are not as accurate as physical-based
                 potentials when atomic resolution is required. Several
                 recent applications of physical-based energy functions
                 to loop selections appear to support this view. In this
                 article, we apply a recently developed DFIRE-based
                 statistical potential to three different loop decoy
                 sets (RAPPER, Jacobson, and Forrest-Woolf sets).
                 Together with a rotamer library for side-chain
                 optimization, the performance of DFIRE-based potential
                 in the RAPPER decoy set (385 loop targets) is
                 comparable to that of AMBER/GBSA for short loops (two
                 to eight residues). The DFIRE is more accurate for
                 longer loops (9 to 12 residues). Similar trend is
                 observed when comparing DFIRE with another
                 physical-based OPLS/SGB-NP energy function in the large
                 Jacobson decoy set (788 loop targets). In the
                 Forrest-Woolf decoy set for the loops of membrane
                 proteins, the DFIRE potential performs substantially
                 better than the combination of the CHARMM force field
                 with several solvation models. The results suggest that
                 a single-term DFIRE-statistical energy function can
                 provide an accurate loop prediction at a fraction of
                 computing cost required for more complicate
                 physical-based energy functions. A Web server for
                 academic users is established for loop selection at the
                 softwares/services section of the Web site

abstract = {The distance-dependent structure-derived potentials developed so far all employed a reference state that can be characterized as a residue (atom)-averaged state. Here, we establish a new reference state called the distance-scaled, finite ideal-gas reference (DFIRE) state. The reference state is used to construct a residue-specific all-atom potential of mean force from a database of 1011 nonhomologous (less than 30% homology) protein structures with resolution less than 2 A. The new all-atom potential recognizes more native proteins from 32 multiple decoy sets, and raises an average Z-score by 1.4 units more than two previously developed, residue-specific, all-atom knowledge-based potentials. When only backbone and C{beta} atoms are used in scoring, the performance of the DFIRE-based potential, although is worse than that of the all-atom version, is comparable to those of the previously developed potentials on the all-atom level. In addition, the DFIRE-based all-atom potential provides the most accurate prediction of the stabilities of 895 mutants among three knowledge-based all-atom potentials. Comparison with several physical-based potentials is made.

abstract = {Protein structures in the Protein Data Bank provide a wealth of data about the interactions that determine the native states of proteins. Using the probability theory, we derive an atomic distance-dependent statistical potential from a sample of native structures that does not depend on any adjustable parameters (Discrete Optimized Protein Energy, or DOPE). DOPE is based on an improved reference state that corresponds to noninteracting atoms in a homogeneous sphere with the radius dependent on a sample native structure; it thus accounts for the finite and spherical shape of the native structures. The DOPE potential was extracted from a nonredundant set of 1472 crystallographic structures. We tested DOPE and five other scoring functions by the detection of the native state among six multiple target decoy sets, the correlation between the score and model error, and the identification of the most accurate non-native structure in the decoy set. For all decoy sets, DOPE is the best performing function in terms of all criteria, except for a tie in one criterion for one decoy set. To facilitate its use in various applications, such as model assessment, loop modeling, and fitting into cryo-electron microscopy mass density maps combined with comparative protein structure modeling, DOPE was incorporated into the modeling package MODELLER-8.

abstract = {The relative strengths of interactions involving polypeptide chains can be estimated with reasonable accuracy with statistical potentials, free-energy functions derived from the frequency of occurrence of structural arrangements of residues or atoms in collections of protein structures. Recent published work has shown that the energetics of side-chain/backbone interactions can be modeled by the {phi}/{Psi} propensities of the 20 amino acids. In this report, the more commonly used {phi}/{Psi} probabilities are demonstrated to fail in evaluating the free energies of protein conformations because of an overriding preference for all helical structures. Comparison of the hypothetical reactions implied by these two different statistics--propensities versus probabilities--leads to the conclusion that the Boltzmann hypothesis may only be applicable for the calculation of statistical potentials after the starting conformation has been specified. This conclusion supports a simple conjecture: The surprising success of the Boltzmann hypothesis in explaining the energetics of protein structures is a direct consequence of a real equilibrium, one extending over evolutionary time that has maintained the stability of each protein within a narrow range of values.
