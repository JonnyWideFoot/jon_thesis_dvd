In this review emphasis is given to solid-state studies, particularly by X-ray diffraction and infrared absorption techniques. Conformational energy calculations are also considered. The discussion is focused both on model peptides and biological activity polypeptide molecules. The tetrapeptide system (Formula: see text), examined allows one to discuss the extended C5 structure and the various folded conformations, namely the C7 (gamma-turn), C8, C10 (beta-turn), C11, and C13 conformations. The four latter forms may include cis peptide configurations. The oxy-analogs to the C7, C10, and C13 conformations and structures containing bifurcated hydrogen bonds are also discussed. The last sections describe intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded peptide structures involving: (1) a side-chain group, (2) the N-protecting group (in synthetic model compounds), and (3) a beta-amino acid.},

They occur as two types, inverse gamma-turns and classic gamma-turns (classic gamma-turns are usually called just gamma-turns but we prefer to add the adjective classic to distinguish them from the word gamma-turn, referring collectively to both). Of the two, classic gamma-turns are less common and are considered by all authors to be extreme rarities in proteins. However, we find that a number do occur in a sample of proteins of known three-dimensional structure. One occurs at the edge of the second hypervariable region of the light chain in some immunoglobulins. All classic gamma-turns except one are associated with a reversal in the main chain direction. In most cases, the turn lies at the loop end of a beta-hairpin. By contrast, inverse gamma-turns, although giving rise to a kink in the chain, rarely occur within beta-hairpins and are seldom situated at a position of reversal, by 180 degrees, in chain direction.},

We point out that their nomenclature, by itself, gives rise to ambiguities, but that, if the class (one of the four mentioned above) is also specified, the description of beta-hairpins becomes straightforward. A range of proteins of known three-dimensional structure has been examined; it provides examples of hairpins of each of the four classes and give some indication of their frequency of occurrence. The distribution observed is substantially different from that described by Sibanda & Thornton [(1985) Nature (London) 316, 170-174].},

Also I show that G1 beta-bulge loops occur in a number of different structural forms, some of which have not been described in detail before.

Isolated alpha-turns, not participating in alpha-helical structures, have received little attention due to the overwhelming presence of other types of tight turns in peptide and protein structures. The growing number of protein X-ray structures allowed us to undertake a systematic search into the Protein Data Bank of this uncharacterized protein secondary structure. A classification of isolated alpha-turns into different types, based on conformational similarity, is reported here. A preliminary analysis on the occurrence of some particular amino acids in certain positions of the turned structure is also presented.},

	abstract = {The i + 5-->i hydrogen bonded turn conformation (pi-turn) with the fifth residue adopting alpha L conformation is frequently found at the C-terminus of helices in proteins and hence is speculated to be a helix termination signal. An analysis of the occurrence of i + 5-->i hydrogen bonded turn conformation at any general position in proteins (not specifically at the helix C-terminus), using coordinates of 228 protein crystal structures determined by X-ray crystallography to better than 2.5 A resolution is reported in this paper. Of 486 detected pi-turn conformations, 367 have the (i + 4)th residue in alpha L conformation, generally occurring at the C-terminus of alpha-helices, consistent with previous observations. However, a significant number (111) of pi-turn conformations occur with (i + 4)th residue in alpha R conformation also, generally occurring in alpha-helices as distortions either at the terminii or at the middle, a novel finding. These two sets of pi-turn conformations are referred to by the names pi alpha L and pi alpha R-turns, respectively, depending upon whether the (i + 4)th residue adopts alpha L or alpha R conformations. Four pi-turns, named pi alpha L'-turns, were noticed to be mirror images of pi alpha L-turns, and four more pi-turns, which have the (i + 4)th residue in beta conformation and dejournal_noted as pi beta-turns, occur as a part of hairpin bend connecting twisted beta-strands. Consecutive pi-turns occur, but only with pi alpha R-turns. The preference for amino acid residues is different in pi alpha L and pi alpha R-turns. However, both show a preference for Pro after the C-termini. Hydrophilic residues are preferred at positions i + 1, i + 2, and i + 3 of pi alpha L-turns, whereas positions i and i + 5 prefer hydrophobic residues. Residue i + 4 in pi alpha L-turns is mainly Gly and less often Asn. Although pi alpha R-turns generally occur as distortions in helices, their amino acid preference is different from that of helices. Poor helix formers, such as His, Tyr, and Asn, also were found to be preferred for pi alpha R-turns, whereas good helix former Ala is not preferred. pi-Turns in peptides provide a picture of the pi-turn at atomic resolution. Only nine peptide-based pi-turns are reported so far, and all of them belong to pi alpha L-turn type with an achiral residue in position i + 4. The results are of importance for structure prediction, modeling, and de novo design of proteins.},

abstract = {Using the new version of a Protein Structural Database, BIPED, {beta}-tums have been extracted from 58 non-identical proteins (resolution [&le;] 2 A) using the standard criteria that the distance between C{alpha}iand C{alpha}i+3 is <7 A and that the central residues are not helical. It has been shown that 42% of these do not fit into the eight conventional turn types (I, I', II, II', VIa, VIb and VIII) as defined by{varphi} ,{psi} limits for residues i+1 and i+2. Most of the unclassified turns are  distortions' of the standard turn types, lying just outside the specified limits. Eleven per cent of the turns are not related to the standard types, and have completely different{varphi} ,{psi} combinations. Therefore, the conformational space available to a trans tetrapeptide has been explored to find all two-residue{varphi} ,{psi} combinations which satisfy the criteria for {beta}-turn formation. The conformations generated by the search are the conformations observed in the data. On the basis of these observations a new nomenclature is suggested for {beta}-turns based on a shorthand descriptor of populated regions of the{varphi} ,{psi} plot. For example, it is proposed that a type I turn should now be described as an {alpha}{alpha} turn, the descriptor indicating the{varphi} ,{psi} regions of the i+1 and i+2 positions of the turn. The use of descriptors, which convey information about the turn type conformation, should aid protein structural workers in turn classification and visualization. The sequence preferences for the {alpha}{beta} turn have been elucidated: Pro, Asp and Ser at i+1; Asn and His at i+2; Pro at i+3. These preferences have been explained in terms of specific interactions involving the side-chains. The {beta}-turn prediction program, BTURN 1.0, has been further developed by alterations to the calculation of parameters, the removal of incompatible multiple turn predictions and the inclusion of the distorted types {alpha}{alpha} and {beta}p{gamma} data in the respective sets of parameters, to yield BTURN 2.0. A variation of this {beta}-turn prediction program, called GORBTURN 1.0, has been developed, which uses the directional parameters of Gibrat et al. in combination with equivalent parameters produced from work by Garrett et al., to eliminate potential helix and strand-forming residues from the {beta}-turn prediction. This has led to improved turn prediction in protein sequences, although it is not suitable for predictions on short peptide sequences. BTURN 2.0 is the program of choice for these sequences. The incorporation of {alpha}{beta} parameters into GORBTURN 1.0 led to a small decrease in predictive accuracy, and therefore these parameters are not yet refined enough to give improved prediction.

                 normally found. The majority of paperclips are shown to
                 have tightly clustered sets of main-chain dihedral
                 angles. These are somewhat similar to, but distinct
                 from, a subgroup of another common family of loops that
                 have been called beta-bulge loops; in the latter, the
                 dihedral angles are also tightly clustered. The high
                 degree of clustering in both cases is likely to be a
                 result of steric constraints associated with hydrogen
                 bond patterns at the ends of loops.",

                 polypeptide chain that traces a loop-shaped path in
                 three-dimensional space; the main chain of an idealized
                 loop resembles a Greek omega (omega). A systematic
                 study was made of 67 proteins of known structure
                 revealing 270 omega loops. Although such loops are
                 typically regarded as random coil, they are, in fact,
                 highly compact substructures and may also be
                 independent folding units. Loops are almost invariably
                 situated at the protein surface where they are poised
                 to assume important roles in molecular function and
                 biological recognition. They are often observed to be
                 modules of evolutionary exchange and are also natural
                 candidates for bioengineering studies.",

                 aperiodic segments of protein structure. In an effort
                 to avoid the geometric complexity created by
                 non-repeating phi psi angles, a morphologic definition
                 that focuses upon the linearity and planarity of loops
                 is utilized. Out of 432 loops (4 to 20 residues in
                 length) extracted from 67 proteins, 205 are classified
                 as linear (straps), 133 as non-linear and planar
                 (omegas), and 86 as non-linear and non-planar (zetas).
                 The remaining 8 are classified as compound loops
                 because they contain a combination of strap, omega, and
                 zeta morphologies. We introduce a structural alphabet
                 as a shorthand notation for describing local
                 conformation. The symbols of this alphabet are based on
                 the virtual dihedral angle joining four consecutive
                 alpha carbons. The notation is used to provide a
                 compact description of loop motifs in phosphate binding
                 and calcium binding proteins. Since similar loop
                 conformations form similar words, the structural
                 sequence facilitates the search for common structural
                 motifs in a family of loops. Contrary to the view of
                 loops as random coils, we find loops to have positional
                 preferences for amino acid residues analogous to those
                 previously described for beta-turns.",

                 structures are generally short (80\% are <10 amino
