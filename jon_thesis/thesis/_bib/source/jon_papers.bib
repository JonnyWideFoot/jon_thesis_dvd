  Abstract = {A new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), directly approximates alignments that optimize a measure of local similarity, the maximal segment pair (MSP) score. Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

  abstract =     "Since the first crystal structure of an immunoglobulin
                 revealed a modular architecture, the characteristic
                 beta-sheet fold of the immunoglobulin domain has been
                 found in many other proteins of diverse biological
                 function. Here, a systematic comparison of 23 Ig domain
                 structures with less than 25\% pairwise residue
                 identity was performed using automatic structural
                 alignment and analysis of beta-sheet and loop topology.
                 Sequence consensus patterns were identified for nine
                 distinct families with at most marginal similarity to
                 each other. The analysis reveals a common structural
                 core of only four beta-strands (b, c, e and f),
                 embedded in an antiparallel curled beta-sheet sandwich
                 with a total of three to five additional strands (a,
                 c', c'', d, g) and a characteristic intersheet angle.
                 The variation in the position of the edge strands (a,
                 c', c'', d and g) relative to the common core defines
                 four different topological subtypes that correlate with
                 the length of the intervening sequence between strands
                 c and e, the most variable region in sequence. The
                 switch of strand c' from one sheet to the other in
                 seven-stranded domains appears to result from short c-e
                 segments, rather than being a major structural
                 discriminator. The high degree of structural
                 flexibility outside the common core and the extreme
                 variability of side-chain packing inside the core do
                 not support a protein folding pathway common to all
                 members of the structural class. Mutation rates of
                 immunoglobulin-like domains in different proteins vary
                 considerably. Disulfide bridges, thought to contribute
                 to structural stability, are not necessarily invariant

                 previously described local sequence-structure

                 diverging type-II beta-turn, a frayed helix, and a
                 proline-terminated helix. The query sequence is scanned
                 for segments 7 to 19 residues in length that strongly
                 match one of the 82 patterns in the library. Matching

                 immunoglobulin, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor,
                 and bovine trypsin. The predicted structure is obtained

                 parameters (ASPs) sigma(i) developed recently for
                 cyclic peptides is extended to surface loops in
                 proteins. The loop is free to move, whereas the protein
                 template is held fixed in its X-ray structure. The
                 energy is E(tot) = E(FF)(epsilon = nr) + summation
                 operator sigma(i)A(i), where E(FF)(epsilon = nr) is the
                 force-field energy of the loop-loop and loop-template
                 interactions, epsilon = nr is a distance-dependent
                 dielectric constant, and n is an additional parameter
                 to be optimized. A(i) is the solvent-accessible surface
                 area of atom i. The optimal sigma(i) and n are those
                 for which the loop structure with the global minimum of
                 E(tot)(n, sigma(i)) becomes the experimental X-ray
                 structure. Thus, the ASPs depend on the force field and
                 are optimized in the protein environment, unlike
                 commonly used ASPs such as those of Wesson and
                 Eisenberg (Protein Sci 1992;1:227-235). The latter are
                 based on the free energy of transfer of small molecules
                 from the gas phase to water and have been traditionally
                 combined with various force fields without further
                 calibration. We found that for loops the all-atom AMBER
                 force field performed better than OPLS and CHARMM22.
                 Two sets of ASPs [based on AMBER (n = 2)], optimized
                 independently for loops 64-71 and 89-97 of ribonuclease
                 A, were similar and thus enabled the definition of a
                 best-fit set. All these ASPs were negative
                 (hydrophilic), including those for carbon. Very good
                 (i.e., small) root-mean-square-deviation values from
                 the X-ray loop structure were obtained with the three
                 sets of ASPs, suggesting that the best-fit set would be
                 transferable to loops in other proteins as well. The
                 structure of loop 13-24 is relatively stretched and was
                 insensitive to the effect of the ASPs.",

  Abstract = {The accuracy of model selection from decoy ensembles of protein loop conformations was explored by comparing the performance of the Samudrala-Moult all-atom statistical potential (RAPDF) and the AMBER molecular mechanics force field, including the Generalized Born/surface area solvation model. Large ensembles of consistent loop conformations, represented at atomic detail with idealized geometry, were generated for a large test set of protein loops of 2 to 12 residues long by a novel ab initio method called RAPPER that relies on fine-grained residue-specific phi/psi propensity tables for conformational sampling. Ranking the conformers on the basis of RAPDF scores resulted in selected conformers that had an average global, non-superimposed RMSD for all heavy mainchain atoms ranging from 1.2 A for 4-mers to 2.9 A for 8-mers to 6.2 A for 12-mers. After filtering on the basis of anchor geometry and RAPDF scores, ranking by energy minimization of the AMBER/GBSA potential energy function selected conformers that had global RMSD values of 0.5 A for 4-mers, 2.3 A for 8-mers, and 5.0 A for 12-mers. Minimized fragments had, on average, consistently lower RMSD values (by 0.1 A) than their initial conformations. The importance of the Generalized Born solvation energy term is reflected by the observation that the average RMSD accuracy for all loop lengths was worse when this term is omitted. There are, however, still many cases where the AMBER gas-phase minimization selected conformers of lower RMSD than the AMBER/GBSA minimization. The AMBER/GBSA energy function had better correlation with RMSD to native than the RAPDF. When the ensembles were supplemented with conformations extracted from experimental structures, a dramatic improvement in selection accuracy was observed at longer lengths (average RMSD of 1.3 A for 8-mers) when scoring with the AMBER/GBSA force field. This work provides the basis for a promising hybrid approach of ab initio and knowledge-based methods for loop modeling.},

  abstract =     "We describe a novel method to generate ensembles of
                 conformations of the main-chain atoms [N, C(alpha), C,
                 O, Cbeta] for a sequence of amino acids within the
                 context of a fixed protein framework. Each conformation
                 satisfies fundamental stereo-chemical restraints such
                 as idealized geometry, favorable phi/psi angles, and
                 excluded volume. The ensembles include conformations
                 both near and far from the native structure. Algorithms
                 for effective conformational sampling and constant time
                 overlap detection permit the generation of thousands of
                 distinct conformations in minutes. Unlike previous
                 approaches, our method samples dihedral angles from
                 fine-grained phi/psi state sets, which we demonstrate
                 is superior to exhaustive enumeration from coarse
                 phi/psi sets. Applied to a large set of loop
                 structures, our method samples consistently near-native
                 conformations, averaging 0.4, 1.1, and 2.2 A main-chain
                 root-mean-square deviations for four, eight, and twelve
                 residue long loops, respectively. The ensembles make
                 ideal decoy sets to assess the discriminatory power of
                 a selection method. Using these decoy sets, we conclude
                 that quality of anchor geometry cannot reliably
                 identify near-native conformations, though the
                 selection results are comparable to previous loop
                 prediction methods. In a subsequent study (de Bakker et
                 al.: Proteins 2003;51:21-40), we demonstrate that the
                 AMBER forcefield with the Generalized Born solvation

                 significantly better than previous methods.",

                 connecting regular secondary structures. We identified
                 2,024 loops of one to eight residues in length, with
                 acceptable main-chain bond lengths and peptide bond
                 angles, from a database of 223 protein and
                 protein-domain structures. Each loop is characterized
                 by its sequence, main-chain conformation, and relative
                 disposition of its bounding secondary structures as
                 described by the separation between the tips of their
                 axes and the angle between them. Loops, grouped
                 according to their length and type of their bounding
                 secondary structures, were superposed and clustered
                 into 161 conformational classes, corresponding to 63\%
                 of all loops. Of these, 109 (51\% of the loops) were
                 populated by at least four nonhomologous loops or four
                 loops sharing a low sequence identity. Another 52
                 classes, including 12\% of the loops, were populated by
                 at least three loops of low sequence similarity from
                 three or fewer nonhomologous groups. Loop class
                 suprafamilies resulting from variations in the termini
                 of secondary structures are discussed in this article.
                 Most previously described loop conformations were found
                 among the classes. New classes included a 2:4 type IV
                 hairpin, a helix-capping loop, and a loop that mediates
                 dinucleotide-binding. The relative disposition of
                 bounding secondary structures varies among loop
                 classes, with some classes such as beta-hairpins being
                 very restrictive. For each class, sequence preferences
                 as key residues were identified; those most frequently
                 at these conserved positions than in proteins were Gly,
                 Asp, Pro, Phe, and Cys. Most of these residues are
                 involved in stabilizing loop conformation, often
                 through a positive phi conformation or secondary
                 structure capping. Identification of helix-capping
                 residues and beta-breakers among the highly conserved
                 positions supported our decision to group loops
                 according to their bounding secondary structures.
                 Several of the identified loop classes were associated
                 with specific functions, and all of the member loops
                 had the same function; key residues were conserved for
                 this purpose, as is the case for the parvalbumin-like
                 calcium-binding loops. A significant number, but not
                 all, of the member loops of other loop classes had the
                 same function, as is the case for the helix-turn-helix
                 DNA-binding loops. This article provides a systematic
                 and coherent conformational classification of loops,
                 covering a broad range of lengths and all four
                 combinations of bounding secondary structure types, and
                 supplies a useful basis for modelling of loop
                 conformations where the bounding secondary structures
                 are known or reliably predicted.",

                 comparative modeling of their membrane-spanning
                 regions. However, the ability to predict correctly the
                 structures of loop regions, which may be critical, for
                 example, in ligand binding, remains a considerable
                 challenge. To meet this challenge, accurate scoring
                 methods have to discriminate between candidate
                 conformations of an unknown loop structure. Some
                 success in loop prediction has been reported for
                 globular proteins; however, the proximity of membrane
                 protein loops to the lipid bilayer casts doubt on the
                 applicability of the same scoring methods to this
                 problem. In this work, we develop decoy libraries of
                 non-native folds generated, using the structures of two
                 membrane proteins, with molecular dynamics and Monte
                 Carlo techniques over a range of temperatures. We
                 introduce a new approach for decoy library generation
                 by constructing a flat distribution of conformations
                 covering a wide range of Calpha-root-mean-square
                 deviation (RMSD) from the native structure; this
                 removes possible bias in subsequent scoring stages. We
                 then score these decoy conformations with effective
                 energy functions, using increasingly more cpu-intensive
                 implicit solvent models, including (1) simple Coulombic
                 electrostatics with constant or distance-dependent
                 dielectrics; (2) atomic solvation parameters; (3) the
                 effective energy function (EEF1) of Lazaridis and
                 Karplus; (4) generalized Born/Analytical Continuum
                 Solvent; and (5) finite-difference Poisson-Boltzmann
                 energy functions. We show that distinction of
                 native-like membrane protein loops may be achieved
                 using effective energies with the assumption of a
                 homogenous environment; thus, the absence of the
                 adjacent lipid bilayer does not affect the scoring
                 ability. In particular, the Analytical Continuum

  abstract =     "Fifty-two 3D structures of Ig-like domains covering
                 the immunoglobulin fold family (IgFF) were compared and
                 classified according to the conservation of their
                 secondary structures. Members of the IgFF are distantly
                 related proteins or evolutionarily unrelated proteins
                 with a similar fold, the Ig fold. In this paper, a
                 multiple structural alignment of the conserved common
                 core is described and the correlation between
                 corresponding sequences is discussed. While the members
                 of the IgFF exhibit wide heterogeneity in terms of
                 tissue and species distribution or functional
                 implications, the 3D structures of these domains are
                 far more conserved than their sequences. We define
                 topologically equivalent residues in the Ig-like
                 domains, describe the hydrophobic common cores and
                 discuss the presence of additional strands. The
                 disulfide bridges, not necessary for the stability of
                 the Ig fold, may have an effect on the compactness of
                 the domains. Based upon sequence and structure
                 analysis, we propose the introduction of two new
                 subtypes (C3 and C4) to the previous classifications,
                 in addition to a new global structural classification.
                 The very low mean sequence identity between subgroups
                 of the IgFF suggests the occurrence of both divergent
                 and convergent evolutionary processes, explaining the
                 wide diversity of the superfamily. Finally, this review
                 suggest that hydrophobic residues constituting the
                 common hydrophobic cores are important clues to explain
                 how highly divergent sequences can adopt a similar

                 been developed in order to obtain an ensemble of
                 conformations of a peptide segment from a protein
                 fluctuating at a given temperature. The annealing
                 process was performed with a fast Monte Carlo method
                 using the scaled collective variables developed by
                 Noguti and Go. The system was divided into two parts:
                 one consists of one or more peptide segments and is
                 flexible around the main-chain and side-chain torsional
                 angles; the other represents the rest of the molecule
                 and was maintained fixed at the atomic positions
                 determined by x-ray experiments. The target function
                 included the nonbonding atomic interactions and a
                 distance function to anchor the N and C terminal ends
                 of each segment to the fixed part. Three systems of
                 complementary determining regions (CDR) of antibodies
                 were tested and compared to x-ray data: L2 loop (7
                 residues) of the light chain of lambda-type Bence-Jones
                 protein, H1 and the H2 loops (14 residues) of McPC603,
                 and H1 and H2 loops (12 residues) of HyHEL-5. Each
                 state of CDR conformations was characterized at room
                 temperature by the average of their coordinates
                 (average conformation) and the internal energy. With a
                 limited number of annealing processes (10), starting
                 from the extended conformation, we have obtained states
                 with conformations close to the observed x-ray
                 structures, from 1.1 to 1.7 A root mean square
                 deviation (rmsd) of main-chain atoms depending on the
                 system. These states were identical or within 0.25 A
                 rmsd of those of lowest internal energy. For unknown
                 CDR structures the criteria of lowest internal energies
                 from ESAP can be used to predict hypervariable loop

                 reduced models, employing the united atom
                 representation, to all-atom models of the molecular

                 reduced model, its force field and applications in the
                 structural proteomics. The model uses a lattice
                 representation with 800 possible orientations of the
                 virtual alpha carbon-alpha carbon bonds. The sampling
                 scheme of the conformational space employs the Replica
                 Exchange Monte Carlo method. Knowledge-based potentials
                 of the force field include: generic protein-like
                 conformational biases, statistical potentials for the
                 short-range conformational propensities, a model of the

                 Especially, the new approach to comparative modeling
                 could be a valuable tool of the structural proteomics.

                 provides useful local structural information that goes
                 beyond conventional three-state (alpha, beta and coil)
                 secondary structure predictions. Accurate prediction of
                 protein backbone torsion angles will substantially
                 improve modeling procedures for local structures of
                 protein sequence segments, especially in modeling loop
                 conformations that do not form regular structures as in
                 alpha-helices or beta-strands. RESULTS: We have devised
                 two novel automated methods in protein backbone
                 conformational state prediction: one method is based on
                 support vector machines (SVMs); the other method
                 combines a standard feed-forward back-propagation
                 artificial neural network (NN) with a local
                 structure-based sequence profile database (LSBSP1).
                 Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that both
                 methods have improved the prediction accuracy rate over
                 the previously published methods for conformation state

                 underlying information, i.e. a fragment data bank as

                 the number of proteins contributing to the data base
                 the more redundant information is included, which leads
                 to structurally similar proposals in loop predictions
                 and to longer times for extracting fragments. So it is
                 not only necessary to increase the number of proteins
                 for building the loop data base but also to cluster the
                 resulting fragments according to their structural

                 structures by protein fragments that are as similar to

                 loop prediction method, examples of insertions and
                 deletions were searched automatically in data sets of
                 structurally aligned protein pairs. Three different
                 criteria were applied for the determination of the
                 positions where the main chain conformations of the
                 proteins begin to differ, i.e., the anchoring groups of
                 the insertions and deletions, giving three test data
                 sets. The target structures in these data sets were
                 predicted by inserting fragments from different
                 fragment data banks between the anchoring groups of the
                 templates. The proposals of matching fragments were
                 sorted with decreasing correspondence in the geometry
                 of the anchoring groups. For assessment of the
                 prediction quality, the template loops were substituted
                 by the proposed ones, and their root mean square
                 deviations to the target structures were determined. In
                 addition, the best 20 fragments in the whole loop data
                 bank used-those with the lowest deviations from the
                 target structures after insertion into the
                 templates-were determined and compared with the
                 proposals. The analysis of the results shows
                 limitations of knowledge-based loop prediction. It is
                 demonstrated that the selection of the anchoring groups
                 is the most important step in the whole procedure.

                 links, beta-beta hairpins, alpha-beta and beta-alpha)
                 according to the secondary structures they embrace.
                 Four variables have been used to describe the loop
                 geometry, three angles and one distance between the
                 secondary structure elements embracing the loop.
                 Ramachandran angles (phi, psi) are used to define the
                 loop conformations within each brace geometry. All
                 loops from the non-redundant set have been clustered by
                 means of these geometric features. A total of 56

                 loops forming the complementarity determining region
                 (CDR) 3 of the heavy chain (H3) into canonical classes.
                 Previous analyses of the three-dimensional structures
                 of CDR loops (also known as the hypervariable regions)
                 within antibody immunoglobulin variable domains have
                 shown that for five of the six CDRs there are only a
                 few main-chain conformations (known as canonical forms)
                 that show clear relationships between sequence and
                 structure. However, the larger variation in length and
                 conformation of loops within H3 has limited the
                 classification of these loops into canonical forms. The
                 clustering procedure presented here is based on
                 aligning the Ramachandran-coded main-chain conformation
                 of the residues using a dynamic algorithm that allows
                 the insertion of gaps to obtain an optimum alignment. A
                 total of 41 H3 loops out of 62 non-identical loops,
                 extracted from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, have
                 been automatically grouped into 22 clusters. Inspection
                 of the clusters for consensus sequences or intra-loop
                 interactions or invariant conformation led to the
                 proposal of 13 canonical forms representing 31 loops.
                 These canonical forms include a consideration of the
                 geometry of both the take-off region adjacent to the
                 bracing beta-strands and the remaining loop apex.
                 Subsequently a new set of 15 H3 loops not included in
                 the initial analysis was considered. The clustering
                 procedure was repeated and nine of these 15 loops could
                 be assigned to original clusters, including seven to
                 canonical forms. A sequence profile was generated for
                 each canonical form from the original set of loops and
                 matched against the sequences of the new H3 loops. For
                 five out of the seven new H3 loops that were in a
                 canonical form, the correct form was identified at
                 first rank by this predictive scheme.",

                 evaluation to simple dielectric screening of
                 charge-charge interactions. This paper compares
                 different solvent models applied to the problem of
                 estimating the free-energy difference between two loop
                 conformations in acetylcholinesterase. Molecular
                 dynamics (MD) simulations were used to sample potential
                 energy surfaces of the two basins with solvent treated
                 by means of explicit and implicit methods. Implicit
                 solvent methods studied include the generalized Born
                 (GB) model, atomic solvation potential (ASP), and the
                 distance-dependent dieletric constant. By using the
                 linear response approximation (LRA), the explicit
                 solvent calculations determined a free-energy
                 difference that is in excellent agreement with the
                 experimental estimate, while rescoring the protein
                 conformations with GB or the Poisson equation showed
                 inconsistent and inferior results. While the approach
                 of rescoring conformations from explicit water
                 simulations with implicit solvent models is popular
                 among many applications, it perturbs the energy
                 landscape by changing the solvent contribution to
                 microstates without conformational relaxation, thus
                 leading to non-optimal solvation free energies.
                 Calculations applying MD with a GB solvent model
                 produced results of comparable accuracy as observed
                 with LRA, yet the electrostatic free-energy terms were
                 significantly different due to optimization on a
                 potential energy surface favored by an implicit solvent
                 reaction field. The simpler methods of ASP and the
                 distance-dependent scaling of the dielectric constant
                 both produced considerable distortions in the protein

  abstract =     "Limitations in protein homology modeling often arise
                 from the inability to adequately model loops. In this
                 paper we focus on the selection of loop conformations.
                 We present a complete computational treatment that
                 allows the screening of loop conformations to identify
                 those that best fit a molecular model. The stability of
                 a loop in a protein is evaluated via computations of
                 conformational free energies in solution, i.e., the
                 free energy difference between the reference structure
                 and the modeled one. A thermodynamic cycle is used for
                 calculation of the conformational free energy, in which
                 the total free energy of the reference state (i.e., gas
                 phase) is the CHARMm potential energy. The
                 electrostatic contribution of the solvation free energy
                 is obtained from solving the finite-difference
                 Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The nonpolar contribution
                 is based on a surface area-based expression. We applied
                 this computational scheme to a simple but
                 well-characterized system, the antibody hypervariable
                 loop (complementarity-determining region, CDR). Instead
                 of creating loop conformations, we generated a database
                 of loops extracted from high-resolution crystal
                 structures of proteins, which display geometrical
                 similarities with antibody CDRs. We inserted loops from
                 our database into a framework of an antibody; then we
                 calculated the conformational free energies of each
                 loop. Results show that we successfully identified
                 loops with a reference-like CDR geometry, with the
                 lowest conformational free energy in gas phase only.
                 Surprisingly, the solvation energy term plays a
                 confusing role, sometimes discriminating reference-like
                 CDR geometry and many times allowing non-reference-like
                 conformations to have the lowest conformational free
                 energies (for short loops). Most reference-like loop
                 conformations are separated from others by a gap in the
                 gas phase conformational free energy scale. Naturally,
                 loops from antibody molecules are found to be the best
                 models for long CDRs (> or = 6 residues), mainly
                 because of a better packing of backbone atoms into the
                 framework of the antibody model.",

                 methods is the accuracy with which regions that are
                 structurally divergent from homologues of known
                 structure can be modeled. Because structural
                 differences between homologous proteins are responsible
                 for variations in protein function and specificity, the
                 ability to model these differences has important
                 functional consequences. Although existing methods can
                 provide reasonably accurate models of short loop
                 regions, modeling longer structurally divergent regions
                 is an unsolved problem. Here we describe a method based
                 on the de novo structure prediction algorithm, Rosetta,
                 for predicting conformations of structurally divergent
                 regions in comparative models. Initial conformations
                 for short segments are selected from the protein
                 structure database, whereas longer segments are built
                 up by using three- and nine-residue fragments drawn
                 from the database and combined by using the Rosetta
                 algorithm. A gap closure term in the potential in
                 combination with modified Newton's method for gradient
                 descent minimization is used to ensure continuity of
                 the peptide backbone. Conformations of variable regions
                 are refined in the context of a fixed template
                 structure using Monte Carlo minimization together with
                 rapid repacking of side-chains to iteratively optimize
                 backbone torsion angles and side-chain rotamers. For
                 short loops, mean accuracies of 0.69, 1.45, and 3.62 A
                 are obtained for 4, 8, and 12 residue loops,
                 respectively. In addition, the method can provide
                 reasonable models of conformations of longer protein
                 segments: predicted conformations of 3A
                 root-mean-square deviation or better were obtained for
                 5 of 10 examples of segments ranging from 13 to 34
                 residues. In combination with a sequence alignment
                 algorithm, this method generates complete, ungapped
                 models of protein structures, including regions both
                 similar to and divergent from a homologous structure.
                 This combined method was used to make predictions for
                 28 protein domains in the Critical Assessment of
                 Protein Structure 4 (CASP 4) and 59 domains in CASP 5,
                 where the method ranked highly among comparative
                 modeling and fold recognition methods. Model accuracy
                 in these blind predictions is dominated by alignment
                 quality, but in the context of accurate alignments,
                 long protein segments can be accurately modeled.
                 Notably, the method correctly predicted the local

                 structure are by way of homologous extension, using
                 structural information from a closely related protein,
                 or by threading through a set of predefined protein
                 folds (inverse folding). Both sets of methods provide a
                 model for the core of the protein--the structurally
                 conserved secondary structures. Due to the large
                 variability both in sequence and size of the loops that
                 connect these secondary structures, they generally
                 cannot be modeled using these techniques. Loop-closure
                 algorithms are aimed at predicting loop structures,
                 given their end-to-end distance. Various such
                 algorithms have been described, and all have been
                 tested by predicting the structure of a single loop in
                 a known protein. In this paper we propose a method,
                 which is based on the bond-scaling-relaxation
                 loop-closure algorithm, for simultaneously predicting
                 the structures of multiple loops, and demonstrate that,
                 for two spatially close loops, simultaneous closure
                 invariably leads to more accurate predictions than
                 sequential closure. The accuracy of the predictions
                 obtained for pairs of loops in the size range of 5-7
                 residues each is comparable to that obtained by other

                 computationally efficient method for constructing these

                 approaches were used to construct side chain
                 conformations on a range of near-native main chains
                 generated by ab initio protein structure prediction

                 observed rotamer for a given amino acid to construct
                 side chains. An all-atom conditional probability
                 discriminatory function is useful at selecting

                 the construction of accurate comparative models. We
                 present an algorithm that uses graph theory to handle
                 this problem. Each possible conformation of a residue
                 in an amino acid sequence is represented using the
                 notion of a node in a graph. Each node is given a
                 weight based on the degree of the interaction between
                 its side-chain atoms and the local main-chain atoms.
                 Edges are then drawn between pairs of residue
                 conformations/nodes that are consistent with each other
                 (i.e. clash-free and satisfying geometrical
                 constraints). The edges are weighted based on the
                 interactions between the atoms of the two nodes. Once
                 the entire graph is constructed, all the maximal sets
                 of completely connected nodes (cliques) are found using
                 a clique-finding algorithm. The cliques with the best
                 weights represent the optimal combinations of the
                 various main-chain and side-chain possibilities, taking
                 the respective environments into account. The algorithm
                 is used in a comparative modeling scenario to build

                 conformations of a protein sequence are enumerated

                 library of discrete side chain conformations extracted
                 from the Protein Data Bank. These side chain conformer
                 libraries are extracted automatically from high-quality
                 protein structures using stringent filters and maintain
                 crystallographic bond lengths and angles. This

                 similar, e.g., within 4A Root Mean Square Deviation
                 (RMSD), to some base structure. Current methods to do
                 this are designed to produce only small deviations (<
                 0.1A RMSD) and are inefficient for larger deviations.
                 The method proposed in this paper, ChainTweak, can
                 generate conformations with larger deviations from the
                 base much more efficiently. For example, in 18 seconds
                 it can generate 100 backbone conformations, each within
                 1-4A RMSD of a given 45-residue conformation. Moreover,
                 each conformation has correct bond lengths, angles and
                 omega torsional angles; its phi-psi angles have
                 energetically favorable values; and there are rarely

                 solvation models, gas-phase conformations were
                 generated in which side chains were kept extended so as
                 to maximize their interaction with the solvent. The
                 free energies of these conformations were compared to
                 that calculated for the crystal structure in three
                 loops of the protein E. coli RNase H, with lengths of
                 7, 8, and 9 residues. Free energies were evaluated with
                 a finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann (FDPB)
                 calculation for electrostatics and a surface area-based
                 term for nonpolar contributions. These were added to a
                 gas-phase potential function. A free energy function
                 based on atomic solvation parameters was also tested.
                 Both functions were quite successful in selecting,
                 based on a free energy criterion, conformations quite
                 close to the crystal structure for two of the three
                 loops. For one loop, which is involved in crystal
                 contacts, conformations that are quite different from
                 the crystal structure were also selected. A method to
                 avoid precision problems associated with using the FDPB
                 method to evaluate conformational free energies in
                 proteins is described.",

                 cull the PDB by-entry in addition to the standard
                 culling by individual chains. In this scenario, a list

                 protein structure prediction by homology is still an
                 unsolved problem. In an earlier publication, we could
                 show that the correct placement of the amino acids
                 serving as an anchor group to be connected by a loop
                 fragment with a predicted geometry is a highly
                 important step and an essential requirement within the
                 process (Lessel and Schomburg, Proteins 1999;
                 37:56-64). In this article, we present an analysis of
                 the quality of possible loop predictions with respect
                 to gap length, fragment length, amino acid type,
                 secondary structure, and solvent accessibility. For 550
                 insertions and 544 deletions, we test all possible
                 positions for anchor groups with an inserted loop of a
                 length between 3 and 12 amino acids. We could show that
                 approximately 80\% of the indel regions could be
                 predicted within 1.5 A RMSD from a knowledge-based loop
                 data base if criteria for the correct localization of
                 anchor groups could be found and the loops can be
                 sorted correctly. From our analysis, several
                 conclusions regarding the optimal placement of anchor
                 groups become obvious: (1) The correct placement of
                 anchor groups is even more important for longer gap
                 lengths, (2) medium length fragments (length 5-8)
                 perform better than short or long ones, (3) the
                 placement of anchor groups at hydrophobic amino acids
                 gives a higher chance to include the best possible
                 loop, (4) anchor groups within secondary structure
                 elements, in particular beta-sheets are suitable, (5)
                 amino acids with lower solvent accessibility are better
                 anchor group. A preliminary test using a combination of
                 the anchor group positioning criteria deduced from our
                 analysis shows very promising results.",

                 conformational sampling were systematically evaluated
                 by studying the side-chain placement of Phe-14 in
                 protein Zif268. The multiple copy sampling is shown to
                 be significantly more efficient when a flexible but
                 harmonically constrained protein is used instead of a
                 rigid protein. A range of constraint force from 1 to 25
                 kcal/mol.A per atom is determined to be sufficient to
                 prevent the protein from distortion while allowing the
                 protein to fluctuate for enhanced sampling. The protein
                 fluctuations are essential in smoothing the effective
                 energy surface as shown by the opening-closing of a
                 protein hydrophobic pocket during a multiple copy
                 energy minimization, a phenomenon that has been
                 previously observed only in molecular dynamics. These
                 results provide a practical guidance for applying the
                 multiple copy techniques to molecular modeling and
                 computer-aided drug design.",

                 scaling-relaxation method for loop closure were
                 examined by using extensive conformational sampling.
                 For each of the eight heptapeptides chosen to represent
                 a variety of protein conformations, 1,000-2,000
                 conformations were sampled. Each segment contained 14
                 rotatable backbone dihedral angles. The average root
                 mean square deviations (RMSDs) between the predicted
                 and the native conformations were 0.7 angstrom for the
                 backbone and 1.2 angstroms for the side chain atoms.
                 These predictions were substantially more accurate than
                 the previous predictions (1.1 angstroms for the
                 backbone and 2.2 angstroms for the side chain atoms) of
                 the same eight protein segments based on limited
                 conformational sampling (100 conformations for each
                 segment). Large prediction errors mostly occurred at
                 polar and surface side chains that are unlikely to have
                 any meaningful conformation. Moreover, the reliability
                 of seven of the eight predictions was demonstrated with
                 their energy-RMSD and stability-RMSD correlations of
                 the low-energy conformations, where the conformational
                 stability was estimated by using the multiple copy
                 simultaneous sampling method.",
