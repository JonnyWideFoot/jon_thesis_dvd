  Abstract = {A new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), directly approximates alignments that optimize a measure of local similarity, the maximal segment pair (MSP) score. Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

  Abstract = {The BLAST programs are widely used tools for searching protein and DNA databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.},

  Abstract = {Model polypeptide chains were folded into 3-D compact conformations using distance geometry techniques. Interresidue distances were predicted from the hydrophobicity of the monomers and were refined by repeated projections into lower-dimensional spaces. Main-chain hydrogen bond networks were constructed and propagated through the structure by adjusting local conformations to comply with ideal distance constraints around hydrogen bonds. The resulting folds were compact globules with distinct hydrophobic cores and contained secondary structure elements like real protein molecules. Apart from similarity in appearance, several properties of the model chains were also very close to those of native folded polypeptides. The method in its present form can serve as a starting point for the development of a novel structure prediction algorithm.},

  Abstract = {It would often be useful in computer simulations to use a simple description of solvation effects, instead of explicitly representing the individual solvent molecules. Continuum dielectric models often work well in describing the thermodynamic aspects of aqueous solvation, and approximations to such models that avoid the need to solve the Poisson equation are attractive because of their computational efficiency. Here we give an overview of one such approximation, the generalized Born model, which is simple and fast enough to be used for molecular dynamics simulations of proteins and nucleic acids. We discuss its strengths and weaknesses, both for its fidelity to the underlying continuum model and for its ability to replace explicit consideration of solvent molecules in macromolecular simulations. We focus particularly on versions of the generalized Born model that have a pair-wise analytical form, and therefore fit most naturally into conventional molecular mechanics calculations.},

  Abstract = {On the basis of its primary sequence and the location of its disulfide bonds, we propose a structural model of the erythropoietic hormone erythropoietin (Epo) which predicts a four alpha-helical bundle motif, in common with other cytokines. In order to test this model, site-directed mutants were prepared by high level transient expression in Cos7 cells and analyzed by a radioimmuno assay and by bioassays utilizing mouse and human Epo-dependent cell lines. Deletions of 5 to 8 residues within predicted alpha-helices resulted in the failure of export of the mutant protein from the cell. In contrast, deletions at the NH2 terminus (delta 2-5), the COOH terminus (delta 163-166), or in predicted interhelical loops (AB: delta 32-36, delta 53-57; BC: delta 78-82; CD: delta 111-119) resulted in the export of immunologically detectable Epo muteins that were biologically active. The mutein delta 48-52 could be readily detected by radioimmunoassay but had markedly decreased biological activity. However, replacement of each of these deleted residues by serine resulted in Epo muteins with full biological activity. Replacement of Cys29 and Cys33 by tyrosine residues also resulted in the export of fully active Epo. Therefore, this small disulfide loop is not critical to Epo's stability or function. The properties of the muteins that we tested are consistent with our proposed model of tertiary structure.},

  Abstract = {Since the first crystal structure of an immunoglobulin revealed a modular architecture, the characteristic beta-sheet fold of the immunoglobulin domain has been found in many other proteins of diverse biological function. Here, a systematic comparison of 23 Ig domain structures with less than 25\% pairwise residue identity was performed using automatic structural alignment and analysis of beta-sheet and loop topology. Sequence consensus patterns were identified for nine distinct families with at most marginal similarity to each other. The analysis reveals a common structural core of only four beta-strands (b, c, e and f), embedded in an antiparallel curled beta-sheet sandwich with a total of three to five additional strands (a, c', c'', d, g) and a characteristic intersheet angle. The variation in the position of the edge strands (a, c', c'', d and g) relative to the common core defines four different topological subtypes that correlate with the length of the intervening sequence between strands c and e, the most variable region in sequence. The switch of strand c' from one sheet to the other in seven-stranded domains appears to result from short c-e segments, rather than being a major structural discriminator. The high degree of structural flexibility outside the common core and the extreme variability of side-chain packing inside the core do not support a protein folding pathway common to all members of the structural class. Mutation rates of immunoglobulin-like domains in different proteins vary considerably. Disulfide bridges, thought to contribute to structural stability, are not necessarily invariant in number and location within a subclass.},

  Abstract = {We describe a new method for local protein structure prediction based on a library of short sequence pattern that correlate strongly with protein three-dimensional structural elements. The library was generated using an automated method for finding correlations between protein sequence and local structure, and contains most previously described local sequence-structure correlations as well as new relationships, including a diverging type-II beta-turn, a frayed helix, and a proline-terminated helix. The query sequence is scanned for segments 7 to 19 residues in length that strongly match one of the 82 patterns in the library. Matching segments are assigned the three-dimensional structure characteristic of the corresponding sequence pattern, and backbone torsion angles for the entire query sequence are then predicted by piecing together mutually compatible segment predictions. In predictions of local structure in a test set of 55 proteins, about 50\% of all residues, and 76\% of residues covered by high-confidence predictions, were found in eight-residue segments within 1.4 A of their true structures. The predictions are complementary to traditional secondary structure predictions because they are considerably more specific in turn regions, and may contribute to ab initio tertiary structure prediction and fold recognition.},

  Abstract = {MOTIVATION: The Monte Carlo fragment insertion method for protein tertiary structure prediction (ROSETTA) of Baker and others, has been merged with the I-SITES library of sequence structure motifs and the HMMSTR model for local structure in proteins, to form a new public server for the ab initio prediction of protein structure. The server performs several tasks in addition to tertiary structure prediction, including a database search, amino acid profile generation, fragment structure prediction, and backbone angle and secondary structure prediction. Meeting reasonable service goals required improvements in the efficiency, in particular for the ROSETTA algorithm. RESULTS: The new server was used for blind predictions of 40 protein sequences as part of the CASP4 blind structure prediction experiment. The results for 31 of those predictions are presented here. 61\% of the residues overall were found in topologically correct predictions, which are defined as fragments of 30 residues or more with a root-mean-square deviation in superimposed alpha carbons of less than 6A. HMMSTR 3-state secondary structure predictions were 73\% correct overall. Tertiary structure predictions did not improve the accuracy of secondary structure prediction.},

The model extends the I-sites library by describing the adjacencies of different sequence-structure motifs as observed in the protein database and, by representing overlapping motifs in a much more compact form, achieves a great reduction in parameters. The HMM attributes a considerably higher probability to coding sequence than does an equivalent dipeptide model, predicts secondary structure with an accuracy of 74.3 \%, backbone torsion angles better than any previously reported method and the structural context of beta strands and turns with an accuracy that should be useful for tertiary structure prediction.},

  Abstract = {In protein structure prediction, it is often the case that a protein segment must be adjusted to connect two fixed segments. This occurs during loop structure prediction in homology modeling as well as in ab initio structure prediction. Several algorithms for this purpose are based on the inverse Jacobian of the distance constraints with respect to dihedral angle degrees of freedom. These algorithms are sometimes unstable and fail to converge. We present an algorithm developed originally for inverse kinematics applications in robotics. In robotics, an end effector in the form of a robot hand must reach for an object in space by altering adjustable joint angles and arm lengths. In loop prediction, dihedral angles must be adjusted to move the C-terminal residue of a segment to superimpose on a fixed anchor residue in the protein structure. The algorithm, referred to as cyclic coordinate descent or CCD, involves adjusting one dihedral angle at a time to minimize the sum of the squared distances between three backbone atoms of the moving C-terminal anchor and the corresponding atoms in the fixed C-terminal anchor. The result is an equation in one variable for the proposed change in each dihedral. The algorithm proceeds iteratively through all of the adjustable dihedral angles from the N-terminal to the C-terminal end of the loop. CCD is suitable as a component of loop prediction methods that generate large numbers of trial structures. It succeeds in closing loops in a large test set 99.79\% of the time, and fails occasionally only for short, highly extended loops. It is very fast, closing loops of length 8 in 0.037 sec on average.},

The method is tested on different loops or peptide segments from immunoglobulin, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and bovine trypsin. The predicted structure is obtained from the ensemble average of the coordinates of the Monte Carlo simulation at 300 K, which exhibits the lowest internal energy. The starting conformation of the loop prior to modeling is chosen to be completely extended, and a closing harmonic potential is applied to N, CA, C, and O atoms of the terminal residues. A rigid geometry potential of Robson and Platt (1986, J. Mol. Biol. 188, 259-281) with a united atom representation is used. This we demonstrate to yield a loop structure with good hydrogen bonding and torsion angles in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran map. The average accuracy of the modeling evaluated on the eight modeled loops is 1 A root mean square deviation (rmsd) for the backbone atoms and 2.3 A rmsd for all heavy atoms.},

  Abstract = {We consider the problem of loop closure, i.e., of finding the ensemble of possible backbone structures of a chain segment of a protein molecule that is geometrically consistent with preceding and following parts of the chain whose structures are given. We reduce this problem of determining the loop conformations of six torsions to finding the real roots of a 16th degree polynomial in one variable, based on the robotics literature on the kinematics of the equivalent rotator linkage in the most general case of oblique rotators. We provide a simple intuitive view and derivation of the polynomial for the case in which each of the three pair of torsional axes has a common point. Our method generalizes previous work on analytical loop closure in that the torsion angles need not be consecutive, and any rigid intervening segments are allowed between the free torsions. Our approach also allows for a small degree of flexibility in the bond angles and the peptide torsion angles; this substantially enlarges the space of solvable configurations as is demonstrated by an application of the method to the modeling of cyclic pentapeptides. We give further applications to two important problems. First, we show that this analytical loop closure algorithm can be efficiently combined with an existing loop-construction algorithm to sample loops longer than three residues. Second, we show that Monte Carlo minimization is made severalfold more efficient by employing the local moves generated by the loop closure algorithm, when applied to the global minimization of an eight-residue loop. Our loop closure algorithm is freely available at http://dillgroup. ucsf.edu/loop_closure/.},

  Abstract = {A new method is presented to examine the complete range of folded topologies accessible in the compact state of globular proteins. The procedure is to generate all conformations, with volume exclusion, upon a lattice in a space restricted to the individual protein's known compact conformational space. Using one lattice point per residue, we find 10(2)-10(4) possible compact conformations for the five small globular proteins studied. Subsequently, these conformations are evaluated in terms of residue-specific, pairwise contact energies that favor nonbonded, hydrophobic interactions. Native structures for the five proteins are always found within the best 2\% of all conformers generated. This novel method is simple and general and can be used to determine a small group of most favorable overall arrangements for the folding of specific amino acid sequences within a restricted space.},

  Abstract = {A novel procedure for optimizing the atomic solvation parameters (ASPs) sigma(i) developed recently for cyclic peptides is extended to surface loops in proteins. The loop is free to move, whereas the protein template is held fixed in its X-ray structure. The energy is E(tot) = E(FF)(epsilon = nr) + summation operator sigma(i)A(i), where E(FF)(epsilon = nr) is the force-field energy of the loop-loop and loop-template interactions, epsilon = nr is a distance-dependent dielectric constant, and n is an additional parameter to be optimized. A(i) is the solvent-accessible surface area of atom i. The optimal sigma(i) and n are those for which the loop structure with the global minimum of E(tot)(n, sigma(i)) becomes the experimental X-ray structure. Thus, the ASPs depend on the force field and are optimized in the protein environment, unlike commonly used ASPs such as those of Wesson and Eisenberg (Protein Sci 1992;1:227-235). The latter are based on the free energy of transfer of small molecules from the gas phase to water and have been traditionally combined with various force fields without further calibration. We found that for loops the all-atom AMBER force field performed better than OPLS and CHARMM22. Two sets of ASPs [based on AMBER (n = 2)], optimized independently for loops 64-71 and 89-97 of ribonuclease A, were similar and thus enabled the definition of a best-fit set. All these ASPs were negative (hydrophilic), including those for carbon. Very good (i.e., small) root-mean-square-deviation values from the X-ray loop structure were obtained with the three sets of ASPs, suggesting that the best-fit set would be transferable to loops in other proteins as well. The structure of loop 13-24 is relatively stretched and was insensitive to the effect of the ASPs.},

  Abstract = {The accuracy of model selection from decoy ensembles of protein loop conformations was explored by comparing the performance of the Samudrala-Moult all-atom statistical potential (RAPDF) and the AMBER molecular mechanics force field, including the Generalized Born/surface area solvation model. Large ensembles of consistent loop conformations, represented at atomic detail with idealized geometry, were generated for a large test set of protein loops of 2 to 12 residues long by a novel ab initio method called RAPPER that relies on fine-grained residue-specific phi/psi propensity tables for conformational sampling. Ranking the conformers on the basis of RAPDF scores resulted in selected conformers that had an average global, non-superimposed RMSD for all heavy mainchain atoms ranging from 1.2 A for 4-mers to 2.9 A for 8-mers to 6.2 A for 12-mers. After filtering on the basis of anchor geometry and RAPDF scores, ranking by energy minimization of the AMBER/GBSA potential energy function selected conformers that had global RMSD values of 0.5 A for 4-mers, 2.3 A for 8-mers, and 5.0 A for 12-mers. Minimized fragments had, on average, consistently lower RMSD values (by 0.1 A) than their initial conformations. The importance of the Generalized Born solvation energy term is reflected by the observation that the average RMSD accuracy for all loop lengths was worse when this term is omitted. There are, however, still many cases where the AMBER gas-phase minimization selected conformers of lower RMSD than the AMBER/GBSA minimization. The AMBER/GBSA energy function had better correlation with RMSD to native than the RAPDF. When the ensembles were supplemented with conformations extracted from experimental structures, a dramatic improvement in selection accuracy was observed at longer lengths (average RMSD of 1.3 A for 8-mers) when scoring with the AMBER/GBSA force field. This work provides the basis for a promising hybrid approach of ab initio and knowledge-based methods for loop modeling.},

  Abstract = {We present a fast ab initio method for the prediction of local conformations in proteins. The program, PETRA, selects polypeptide fragments from a computer-generated database (APD) encoding all possible peptide fragments up to twelve amino acids long. Each fragment is defined by a representative set of eight straight phi/psi pairs, obtained iteratively from a trial set by calculating how fragments generated from them represent the protein databank (PDB). Ninety-six percent (96\%) of length five fragments in crystal structures, with a resolution better than 1.5 A and less than 25\% identity, have a conformer in the database with less than 1 A root-mean-square deviation (rmsd). In order to select segments from APD, PETRA uses a set of simple rule-based filters, thus reducing the number of potential conformations to a manageable total. This reduced set is scored and sorted using rmsd fit to the anchor regions and a knowledge-based energy function dependent on the sequence to be modelled. The best scoring fragments can then be optimized by minimization of contact potentials and rmsd fit to the core model. The quality of the prediction made by PETRA is evaluated by calculating both the differences in rmsd and backbone torsion angles between the final model and the native fragment. The average rmsd ranges from 1.4 A for three residue loops to 3.9 A for eight residue loops.},

  Abstract = {CODA, an algorithm for predicting the variable regions in proteins, combines FREAD a knowledge based approach, and PETRA, which constructs the region ab initio. FREAD selects from a database of protein structure fragments with environmentally constrained substitution tables and other rule-based filters. FREAD was parameterized and tested on over 3000 loops. The average root mean square deviation ranged from 0.78 A for three residue loops to 3.5 A for eight residue loops on a nonhomologous test set. CODA clusters the predictions from the two independent programs and makes a consensus prediction that must pass a set of rule-based filters. CODA was parameterized and tested on two unrelated separate sets of structures that were nonhomologous to one another and those found in the FREAD database. The average root mean square deviation in the test set ranged from 0.76A for three residue loops to 3.09 A for eight residue loops. CODA shows a general improvement in loop prediction over PETRA and FREAD individually. The improvement is far more marked for lengths six and upward, probably as the predictive power of PETRA becomes more important. CODA was further tested on several model structures to determine its applicability to the modeling situation.

  Abstract = {We describe a novel method to generate ensembles of conformations of the main-chain atoms [N, C(alpha), C, O, Cbeta] for a sequence of amino acids within the context of a fixed protein framework. Each conformation satisfies fundamental stereo-chemical restraints such as idealized geometry, favorable phi/psi angles, and excluded volume. The ensembles include conformations both near and far from the native structure. Algorithms for effective conformational sampling and constant time overlap detection permit the generation of thousands of distinct conformations in minutes. Unlike previous approaches, our method samples dihedral angles from fine-grained phi/psi state sets, which we demonstrate is superior to exhaustive enumeration from coarse phi/psi sets. Applied to a large set of loop structures, our method samples consistently near-native conformations, averaging 0.4, 1.1, and 2.2 A main-chain root-mean-square deviations for four, eight, and twelve residue long loops, respectively. The ensembles make ideal decoy sets to assess the discriminatory power of a selection method. Using these decoy sets, we conclude that quality of anchor geometry cannot reliably identify near-native conformations, though the selection results are comparable to previous loop prediction methods. In a subsequent study (de Bakker et al.: Proteins 2003;51:21-40), we demonstrate that the AMBER forcefield with the Generalized Born solvation model identifies near-native conformations significantly better than previous methods.},

  Abstract = {Loops are regions of nonrepetitive conformation connecting regular secondary structures. We identified 2,024 loops of one to eight residues in length, with acceptable main-chain bond lengths and peptide bond angles, from a database of 223 protein and protein-domain structures. Each loop is characterized by its sequence, main-chain conformation, and relative disposition of its bounding secondary structures as described by the separation between the tips of their axes and the angle between them. Loops, grouped according to their length and type of their bounding secondary structures, were superposed and clustered into 161 conformational classes, corresponding to 63\% of all loops. Of these, 109 (51\% of the loops) were populated by at least four nonhomologous loops or four loops sharing a low sequence identity. Another 52 classes, including 12\% of the loops, were populated by at least three loops of low sequence similarity from three or fewer nonhomologous groups. Loop class suprafamilies resulting from variations in the termini of secondary structures are discussed in this article. Most previously described loop conformations were found among the classes. New classes included a 2:4 type IV hairpin, a helix-capping loop, and a loop that mediates dinucleotide-binding. The relative disposition of bounding secondary structures varies among loop classes, with some classes such as beta-hairpins being very restrictive. For each class, sequence preferences as key residues were identified; those most frequently at these conserved positions than in proteins were Gly, Asp, Pro, Phe, and Cys. Most of these residues are involved in stabilizing loop conformation, often through a positive phi conformation or secondary structure capping. Identification of helix-capping residues and beta-breakers among the highly conserved positions supported our decision to group loops according to their bounding secondary structures. Several of the identified loop classes were associated with specific functions, and all of the member loops had the same function; key residues were conserved for this purpose, as is the case for the parvalbumin-like calcium-binding loops. A significant number, but not all, of the member loops of other loop classes had the same function, as is the case for the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding loops. This article provides a systematic and coherent conformational classification of loops, covering a broad range of lengths and all four combinations of bounding secondary structure types, and supplies a useful basis for modelling of loop conformations where the bounding secondary structures are known or reliably predicted.},

  Abstract = {The CD2 antigen is largely restricted to cells of the T-lymphocyte lineage and has been established as an important adhesion molecule in interactions between human T lymphocytes and accessory cells. In the adhesion reaction, CD2 on T cells binds to LFA-3 on other cells, with binding through domain 1 of CD2. CD2 can also be a target for the delivery of mitogenic signals to T lymphocytes cultured with combinations of anti-CD2 antibodies. Two predictions that are contradictory have been made for the structure of CD2 domain 1. One suggests an immunoglobulin (Ig) fold, on the basis of sequence patterns conserved in the Ig-superfamily (IgSF), whilst the other proposes a pattern of alternating alpha-helices and beta-strands, on the basis of secondary structure predictions. Thus CD2 domain 1 is an important test case for the validity of IgSF assignments based on sequence patterns. We report here the expression of domain 1 of rat CD2 in an Escherichia coli expression system and have determined a low-resolution solution structure by NMR spectroscopy.},

Moreover, protein loops play an important role in protein function. Here we present ArchDB, a classification database of structural motifs, consisting of one loop plus its bracing secondary structures. ArchDB currently contains 12,665 super-secondary elements classified into 1496 motif subclasses.

  Abstract = {The use of classical molecular dynamics simulations, performed in explicit water, for the refinement of structural models of proteins generated ab initio or based on homology has been investigated. The study involved a test set of 15 proteins that were previously used by Baker and coworkers to assess the efficiency of the ROSETTA method for ab initio protein structure prediction. For each protein, four models generated using the ROSETTA procedure were simulated for periods of between 5 and 400 nsec in explicit solvent, under identical conditions. In addition, the experimentally determined structure and the experimentally derived structure in which the side chains of all residues had been deleted and then regenerated using the WHATIF program were simulated and used as controls. A significant improvement in the deviation of the model structures from the experimentally determined structures was observed in several cases. In addition, it was found that in certain cases in which the experimental structure deviated rapidly from the initial structure in the simulations, indicating internal strain, the structures were more stable after regenerating the side-chain positions. Overall, the results indicate that molecular dynamics simulations on a tens to hundreds of nanoseconds time scale are useful for the refinement of homology or ab initio models of small to medium-size proteins.},

  Abstract = {In protein structure prediction, a central problem is defining the structure of a loop connecting 2 secondary structures. This problem frequently occurs in homology modeling, fold recognition, and in several strategies in ab initio structure prediction. In our previous work, we developed a classification database of structural motifs, ArchDB. The database contains 12,665 clustered loops in 451 structural classes with information about phi-psi angles in the loops and 1492 structural subclasses with the relative locations of the bracing secondary structures. Here we evaluate the extent to which sequence information in the loop database can be used to predict loop structure. Two sequence profiles were used, a HMM profile and a PSSM derived from PSI-BLAST. A jack-knife test was made removing homologous loops using SCOP superfamily definition and predicting afterwards against recalculated profiles that only take into account the sequence information. Two scenarios were considered: (1) prediction of structural class with application in comparative modeling and (2) prediction of structural subclass with application in fold recognition and ab initio. For the first scenario, structural class prediction was made directly over loops with X-ray secondary structure assignment, and if we consider the top 20 classes out of 451 possible classes, the best accuracy of prediction is 78.5\%. In the second scenario, structural subclass prediction was made over loops using PSI-PRED (Jones, J Mol Biol 1999;292:195-202) secondary structure prediction to define loop boundaries, and if we take into account the top 20 subclasses out of 1492, the best accuracy is 46.7\%. Accuracy of loop prediction was also evaluated by means of RMSD calculations.},

  Abstract = {We describe a method for predicting the conformations of loops in proteins and its application to four of the complementarity determining regions [CDRs] in the crystallographically determined structure of MCPC603. The method is based on the generation of a large number of randomly generated conformations for the backbone of the loop being studied, followed by either minimization or molecular dynamics followed by minimization starting from these random structures. The details of the algorithm for the generation of the loops are presented in the first paper in this series (Shenkin et al. [submitted]). The results of minimization and molecular dynamics applied to these loops is presented here. For the two shortest CDRs studied (H1 and L2, which are five and seven amino acids long), minimizations and dynamics simulations which ignore interactions of the loop amino acids beyond the carbon beta replicate the conformation of the crystal structure closely. This suggests that these loops fold independently of sequence variation. For the third CDR (L3, which is nine amino acids), those portions of the CDR near its base which are hydrogen bonded to framework are well replicated by our procedures, but the top of the loop shows significant conformational variability. This variability persists when side chain interactions for the MCPC603 sequence are included. For a fourth CDR (H3, which is 11 amino acids long), new low-energy backbone conformations are found; however, only those which are close to the crystal are compatible with the sequence when side chain interactions are taken into account. Results from minimization and dynamics on single CDRs with all other CDRs removed are presented. These allow us to explore the extent to which individual CDR conformations are determined by interactions with framework only.},

We have developed a convenient repository of all remaining structure after these two regular secondary structure elements are removed. The Protein Coil Library (http://roselab.jhu.edu/coil/) allows rapid and comprehensive access to non-alpha-helix and non-beta-strand fragments contained in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The library contains both sequence and structure information together with calculated torsion angles for both the backbone and side chains. Several search options are implemented, including a query function that uses output from popular PDB-culling servers directly. Additionally, several popular searches are stored and updated for immediate access. The library is a useful tool for exploring conformational propensities, turn motifs, and a recent model of the unfolded state.},

  Abstract = {The recent determination of crystal structures for several important membrane proteins opens the way for comparative modeling of their membrane-spanning regions. However, the ability to predict correctly the structures of loop regions, which may be critical, for example, in ligand binding, remains a considerable challenge. To meet this challenge, accurate scoring methods have to discriminate between candidate conformations of an unknown loop structure. Some success in loop prediction has been reported for globular proteins; however, the proximity of membrane protein loops to the lipid bilayer casts doubt on the applicability of the same scoring methods to this problem. In this work, we develop decoy libraries of non-native folds generated, using the structures of two membrane proteins, with molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques over a range of temperatures. We introduce a new approach for decoy library generation by constructing a flat distribution of conformations covering a wide range of Calpha-root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from the native structure; this removes possible bias in subsequent scoring stages. We then score these decoy conformations with effective energy functions, using increasingly more cpu-intensive implicit solvent models, including (1) simple Coulombic electrostatics with constant or distance-dependent dielectrics; (2) atomic solvation parameters; (3) the effective energy function (EEF1) of Lazaridis and Karplus; (4) generalized Born/Analytical Continuum Solvent; and (5) finite-difference Poisson-Boltzmann energy functions. We show that distinction of native-like membrane protein loops may be achieved using effective energies with the assumption of a homogenous environment; thus, the absence of the adjacent lipid bilayer does not affect the scoring ability. In particular, the Analytical Continuum Solvent and finite-difference Poisson-Boltzmann energy functions are seen to be the most powerful scoring functions. Interestingly, the use of the uncharged states of ionizable sidechains is shown to aid prediction, particularly for the simplest energy functions.},

  Abstract = {This study presents different procedures for ab initio modeling of peptide loops of different sizes in proteins. Small loops (up to 8--12 residues) were generated by a straightforward procedure with subsequent averaging over all the low-energy conformers obtained. The averaged conformer fairly represents the entire set of low-energy conformers, root mean square deviation (RMSD) values being from 1.01 A for a 4-residue loop to 1.94 A for an 8-residue loop. Three-dimensional (3D) structures for several medium loops (20--30 residues) and for two large loops (54 and 61 residues) were predicted using residue-residue contact matrices divided into variable parts corresponding to the loops, and into a constant part corresponding to the known core of the protein. For each medium loop, a very limited number of sterically reasonable C(alpha) traces (from 1 to 3) was found; RMSD values ranged from 2.4 to 5.9 A. Single C(alpha) traces predicted for each of the large loops possessed RMSD values of 4.5 A. Generally, ab initio loop modeling presented in this work combines elements of computational procedures developed both for protein folding and for peptide conformational analysis.},

  Abstract = {This study describes a computational method for ab inito protein structure prediction. Protein conformation has been modeled by using six optimized backbone torsion angles and fixed side chains approximating rotationally averaged real side chains. The approximations aim to keep complexity of the structure description to a minimum without seriously compromising the accuracy of the structural representation. An evolutionary Monte Carlo algorithm has been developed to search through this restricted conformational space to locate low-energy protein structures. A simple physicochemical force field has been developed to assess the energies of different conformations within this structural description. The corresponding residue interaction energies are based on hydrophobic, hydrophilic, steric, and hydrogen-bonding potentials. The search procedure has been used to locate native energy minima from primary sequence alone. The 3-D structures of polypeptides up to 38 residues with both beta and alpha secondary structural elements have been accurately predicted. The search procedure has been found to be highly efficient and follows an energetically and structurally plausible pathway to locate native populations. The simple force field described in the study has been compared with a more complex all-atom model and been found to be similarly effective in predicting the structures of proposed independent folding units.

  Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Consensus structure prediction methods (meta-predictors) have higher accuracy than individual structure prediction algorithms (their components). The goal for the development of the 3D-Jury system is to create a simple but powerful procedure for generating meta-predictions using variable sets of models obtained from diverse sources. The resulting protocol should help to improve the quality of structural annotations of novel proteins. Results: The 3D-Jury system generates meta-predictions from sets of models created using variable methods. It is not necessary to know prior characteristics of the methods. The system is able to utilize immediately new components (additional prediction providers). The accuracy of the system is comparable with other well-tuned prediction servers. The algorithm resembles methods of selecting models generated using ab initio folding simulations. It is simple and offers a portable solution to improve the accuracy of other protein structure prediction protocols. AVAILABILITY: The 3D-Jury system is available via the Structure Prediction Meta Server (http://BioInfo.PL/Meta/) to the academic community. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 3D-Jury is coupled to the continuous online server evaluation program, LiveBench (http://BioInfo.PL/LiveBench/)},

A data set consisting of 110 high resolution, non-homologous, protein crystal structures from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank was examined. The data set consisted of a total of 18,708 non-Gly residues, which were characterized on the basis of their backbone dihedral angles (phi, psi). Residues falling outside the defined broad allowed limits on the Ramachandran map were chosen and the reported B-factor value of the alpha-carbon atom was used to further select well defined disallowed conformations. The conformations of the selected 66 disallowed residues clustered in distinct regions of the Ramachandran map indicating that specific phi, psi angle distortions are preferred under compulsions imposed by local constraints. The distribution of various amino acid residues in the disallowed residue data set showed a predominance of small polar/charged residues, with bulky hydrophobic residues being infrequent. As a further check, for all the 66 cases non-hydrogen van der Waals short contacts in the protein structures were evaluated and compared with the ideal Ala-dipeptide constructed using disallowed dihedral angle (phi, psi) values. The analysis reveals that short contacts are eliminated in most cases by local distortions of bond angles. An analysis of the conformation of the identified disallowed residues in related protein structures reveals instances of conservation of unusual stereochemistry.},

  Abstract = {Fifty-two 3D structures of Ig-like domains covering the immunoglobulin fold family (IgFF) were compared and classified according to the conservation of their secondary structures. Members of the IgFF are distantly related proteins or evolutionarily unrelated proteins with a similar fold, the Ig fold. In this paper, a multiple structural alignment of the conserved common core is described and the correlation between corresponding sequences is discussed. While the members of the IgFF exhibit wide heterogeneity in terms of tissue and species distribution or functional implications, the 3D structures of these domains are far more conserved than their sequences. We define topologically equivalent residues in the Ig-like domains, describe the hydrophobic common cores and discuss the presence of additional strands. The disulfide bridges, not necessary for the stability of the Ig fold, may have an effect on the compactness of the domains. Based upon sequence and structure analysis, we propose the introduction of two new subtypes (C3 and C4) to the previous classifications, in addition to a new global structural classification. The very low mean sequence identity between subgroups of the IgFF suggests the occurrence of both divergent and convergent evolutionary processes, explaining the wide diversity of the superfamily. Finally, this review suggest that hydrophobic residues constituting the common hydrophobic cores are important clues to explain how highly divergent sequences can adopt a similar fold.},

  Abstract = {The prediction of protein 3D structures close to insertions and deletions or, more generally, loop prediction, is still one of the major challenges in homology modeling projects. In this article, we developed ranking criteria and selection filters to improve knowledge-based loop predictions. These criteria were developed and optimized for a test data set containing 678 insertions and deletions. The examples are, in principle, predictable from the used loop database with an RMSD < 1 A and represent realistic modeling situations. Four noncorrelated criteria for the selection of fragments are evaluated. A fast prefilter compares the distance between the anchor groups in the template protein with the stems of the fragments. The RMSD of the anchor groups is used for fitting and ranking of the selected loop candidates. After fitting, repulsive close contacts of loop candidates with the template protein are used for filtering, and fragments with backbone torsion angles, which are unfavorable according to a knowledge-based potential, are eliminated. By the combined application of these filter criteria to the test set, it was possible to increase the percentage of predictions with a global RMSD < 1 A to over 50\% among the first five ranks, with average global RMSD values for the first rank candidate that are between 1.3 and 2.2 A for different loop lengths. Compared to other examples described in the literature, our large numbers of test cases are not self-predictions, where loops are placed in a protein after a peptide loop has been cut out, but are attempts to predict structural changes that occur in evolution when a protein is affected by insertions and deletions.},

  Abstract = {An extended simulated annealing process (ESAP) has been developed in order to obtain an ensemble of conformations of a peptide segment from a protein fluctuating at a given temperature. The annealing process was performed with a fast Monte Carlo method using the scaled collective variables developed by Noguti and Go. The system was divided into two parts: one consists of one or more peptide segments and is flexible around the main-chain and side-chain torsional angles; the other represents the rest of the molecule and was maintained fixed at the atomic positions determined by x-ray experiments. The target function included the nonbonding atomic interactions and a distance function to anchor the N and C terminal ends of each segment to the fixed part. Three systems of complementary determining regions (CDR) of antibodies were tested and compared to x-ray data: L2 loop (7 residues) of the light chain of lambda-type Bence-Jones protein, H1 and the H2 loops (14 residues) of McPC603, and H1 and H2 loops (12 residues) of HyHEL-5. Each state of CDR conformations was characterized at room temperature by the average of their coordinates (average conformation) and the internal energy. With a limited number of annealing processes (10), starting from the extended conformation, we have obtained states with conformations close to the observed x-ray structures, from 1.1 to 1.7 A root mean square deviation (rmsd) of main-chain atoms depending on the system. These states were identical or within 0.25 A rmsd of those of lowest internal energy. For unknown CDR structures the criteria of lowest internal energies from ESAP can be used to predict hypervariable loop structures in antibodies with an accuracy comparable to other methods.},

  Abstract = {The role of crystal packing in determining the observed conformations of amino acid side-chains in protein crystals is investigated by (1) analysis of a database of proteins that have been crystallized in different unit cells (space group or unit cell dimensions) and (2) theoretical predictions of side-chain conformations with the crystal environment explicitly represented. Both of these approaches indicate that the crystal environment plays an important role in determining the conformations of polar side-chains on the surfaces of proteins. Inclusion of the crystal environment permits a more sensitive measurement of the achievable accuracy of side-chain prediction programs, when validating against structures obtained by X-ray crystallography. Our side-chain prediction program uses an all-atom force field and a Generalized Born model of solvation and is thus capable of modeling simple packing effects (i.e. van der Waals interactions), electrostatic effects, and desolvation, which are all important mechanisms by which the crystal environment impacts observed side-chain conformations. Our results are also relevant to the understanding of changes in side-chain conformation that may result from ligand docking and protein-protein association, insofar as the results reveal how side-chain conformations change in response to their local environment.},

  Abstract = {The application of all-atom force fields (and explicit or implicit solvent models) to protein homology-modeling tasks such as side-chain and loop prediction remains challenging both because of the expense of the individual energy calculations and because of the difficulty of sampling the rugged all-atom energy surface. Here we address this challenge for the problem of loop prediction through the development of numerous new algorithms, with an emphasis on multiscale and hierarchical techniques. As a first step in evaluating the performance of our loop prediction algorithm, we have applied it to the problem of reconstructing loops in native structures; we also explicitly include crystal packing to provide a fair comparison with crystal structures. In brief, large numbers of loops are generated by using a dihedral angle-based buildup procedure followed by iterative cycles of clustering, side-chain optimization, and complete energy minimization of selected loop structures. We evaluate this method by using the largest test set yet used for validation of a loop prediction method, with a total of 833 loops ranging from 4 to 12 residues in length. Average/median backbone root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) to the native structures (superimposing the body of the protein, not the loop itself) are 0.42/0.24 A for 5 residue loops, 1.00/0.44 A for 8 residue loops, and 2.47/1.83 A for 11 residue loops. Median RMSDs are substantially lower than the averages because of a small number of outliers; the causes of these failures are examined in some detail, and many can be attributed to errors in assignment of protonation states of titratable residues, omission of ligands from the simulation, and, in a few cases, probable errors in the experimentally determined structures. When these obvious problems in the data sets are filtered out, average RMSDs to the native structures improve to 0.43 A for 5 residue loops, 0.84 A for 8 residue loops, and 1.63 A for 11 residue loops. In the vast majority of cases, the method locates energy minima that are lower than or equal to that of the minimized native loop, thus indicating that sampling rarely limits prediction accuracy. The overall results are, to our knowledge, the best reported to date, and we attribute this success to the combination of an accurate all-atom energy function, efficient methods for loop buildup and side-chain optimization, and, especially for the longer loops, the hierarchical refinement protocol.},

  Abstract = {In this study, a new ab initio method named CLOOP has been developed to build all-atom loop conformations. In this method, a loop main-chain conformation is generated by sampling main-chain dihedral angles from a restrained varphi/psi set, and the side-chain conformations are built randomly. The CHARMM all-atom force field was used to evaluate the loop conformations. Soft core potentials were used to treat the non-bond interactions, and a designed energy-minimization technique was used to close and optimize the loop conformations. It is shown that the two strategies improve the computational efficiency and the loop-closure rate substantially compared to normal minimization methods. CLOOP was used to construct the conformations of 4-, 8-, and 12-residue loops in Fiser's test set. The average main-chain root-mean-square deviations obtained in 1,000 trials for the 10 different loops of each size are 0.33, 1.27, and 2.77 A, respectively. CLOOP can build all-atom loop conformations with a sampling accuracy comparable with previous loop main-chain construction algorithms.

  Abstract = {Protein modeling could be done on various levels of structural details, from simplified lattice or continuous representations, through high resolution reduced models, employing the united atom representation, to all-atom models of the molecular mechanics. Here I describe a new high resolution reduced model, its force field and applications in the structural proteomics. The model uses a lattice representation with 800 possible orientations of the virtual alpha carbon-alpha carbon bonds. The sampling scheme of the conformational space employs the Replica Exchange Monte Carlo method. Knowledge-based potentials of the force field include: generic protein-like conformational biases, statistical potentials for the short-range conformational propensities, a model of the main chain hydrogen bonds and context-dependent statistical potentials describing the side group interactions. The model is more accurate than the previously designed lattice models and in many applications it is complementary and competitive in respect to the all-atom techniques. The test applications include: the ab initio structure prediction, multitemplate comparative modeling and structure prediction based on sparse experimental data. Especially, the new approach to comparative modeling could be a valuable tool of the structural proteomics. It is shown that the new approach goes beyond the range of applicability of the traditional methods of the protein comparative modeling.},

The models semiquantitatively reproduce the approximate order of events of unfolding as well as subtle mutation effects and effects resulting from differences in sequences of similar folds. The short-time mobility of particular residues, observed in simulations, correlates with the crystallographic temperature factor. The main factor controlling unfolding is the native state topology, with sequence playing a less important role. The correlation with various experiments, especially for sequence-specific effects, strongly suggests that properly designed reduced models of proteins can be used for qualitative studies (or prediction) of protein unfolding pathways.},

  Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Protein backbone torsion angle prediction provides useful local structural information that goes beyond conventional three-state (alpha, beta and coil) secondary structure predictions. Accurate prediction of protein backbone torsion angles will substantially improve modeling procedures for local structures of protein sequence segments, especially in modeling loop conformations that do not form regular structures as in alpha-helices or beta-strands. RESULTS: We have devised two novel automated methods in protein backbone conformational state prediction: one method is based on support vector machines (SVMs); the other method combines a standard feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network (NN) with a local structure-based sequence profile database (LSBSP1). Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that both methods have improved the prediction accuracy rate over the previously published methods for conformation state prediction when using an alphabet of three or four states. AVAILABILITY: LSBSP1 and the NN algorithm have been implemented in PrISM.1, which is available from www.columbia.edu/~ay1/. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data for the SVM method can be downloaded from the Website www.cs.columbia.edu/compbio/backbone.},

  Abstract = {The success achieved for protein structure prediction of loop regions with insertions and deletions by knowledge-based methods depends on the quality of the underlying information, i.e. a fragment data bank as complete as possible is needed. However, the greater the number of proteins contributing to the data base the more redundant information is included, which leads to structurally similar proposals in loop predictions and to longer times for extracting fragments. So it is not only necessary to increase the number of proteins for building the loop data base but also to cluster the resulting fragments according to their structural similarities in order to remove redundancy. Here, a new, non-redundant fragment data bank is described, which is based on all proteins in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (release 7/95) with a resolution > or = 2.0 A and which can be updated easily by including new information from structures to be solved in the future. In the clustering process presented, the resulting clusters are optimized in several cycles until self-consistency. In this way all redundant information is removed without loosing any significantly different fragments. Finally the resulting fragment data bank is analysed with respect to its completeness.},

  Abstract = {The aim of loop prediction in protein homology modeling is to connect the main chain ends of two successive regions, conserved in template and target structures by protein fragments that are as similar to the target as possible. For the development of a new loop prediction method, examples of insertions and deletions were searched automatically in data sets of structurally aligned protein pairs. Three different criteria were applied for the determination of the positions where the main chain conformations of the proteins begin to differ, i.e., the anchoring groups of the insertions and deletions, giving three test data sets. The target structures in these data sets were predicted by inserting fragments from different fragment data banks between the anchoring groups of the templates. The proposals of matching fragments were sorted with decreasing correspondence in the geometry of the anchoring groups. For assessment of the prediction quality, the template loops were substituted by the proposed ones, and their root mean square deviations to the target structures were determined. In addition, the best 20 fragments in the whole loop data bank used-those with the lowest deviations from the target structures after insertion into the templates-were determined and compared with the proposals. The analysis of the results shows limitations of knowledge-based loop prediction. It is demonstrated that the selection of the anchoring groups is the most important step in the whole procedure.

Although such loops are typically regarded as random coil, they are, in fact, highly compact substructures and may also be independent folding units. Loops are almost invariably situated at the protein surface where they are poised to assume important roles in molecular function and biological recognition.

  Abstract = {A general problem in comparative modeling and protein design is the conformational evaluation of loops with a certain sequence in specific environmental protein frameworks. Loops of different sequences and structures on similar scaffolds are common in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). In order to explore both structural and sequential diversity of them, a data base of loops connecting similar secondary structure fragments is constructed by searching the data base of families of structurally similar proteins and PDB. A total of 84 loop families having 2-13 residues are found among the well-determined structures of resolution better than 2.5 A. Eight alpha-alpha, 20 alpha-beta, 19 beta-alpha, and 37 beta-beta families are identified. Every family contains more than 5 loop motifs. In each family, no loops share same sequence and all the frameworks are well superimposed. Forty-three new loop classes are distinguished in the data base. The structural variability of loops in homologous proteins are examined and shown in 44 families. Motif families are characterized with geometric parameters and sequence patterns. The conformations of loops in each family are clustered into subfamilies using average linkage cluster analysis method. Information such as geometric properties, sequence profile, sequential and structural variability in loop, structural alignment parameters, sequence similarities, and clustering results are provided. Correlations between the conformation of loops and loop sequence, motif sequence, and global sequence of PDB chain are examined in order to find how loop structures depend on their sequences and how they are affected by the local and global environment. Strong correlations (R > 0.75) are only found in 24 families. The best R value is 0.98. The data base is available through the Internet.},

  Abstract = {Prediction of protein structure from amino-acid sequence still continues to be an unsolved problem of theoretical molecular biology. One approach to solve it is to construct an appropriate (free) energy function that recognizes the native structures of some selected proteins (whose native structures are known) as the ones distinctively lowest in (free) energy and then to carry out a search of the lowest-energy structure of a new protein. In order to reduce the complexity of the problem and the cost of energy evaluation, the so-called united-residue representation of the polypeptide chain is often applied, in which each amino-acid residue is represented by only a few interaction sites. Once the global energy minimum of the simplified chain has been found, the all-atom structure can easily and reliably be constructed. The search of the lowest-energy structure is usually carried out by means of Monte Carlo methods, though use of more efficient global-optimization methods, especially those of deformation of original energy surface is potentially promising. Monte Carlo search of the conformational space can be accelerated greatly, if the chain is superposed on a discrete lattice (the on-lattice approach). On the other hand, the on-lattice approach prohibits the use of many efficient global-optimization methods, because they require both energy and its space derivatives. The on-lattice methods in which the chain is embedded in the continuous 3D space are, therefore, also worth developing. In this paper we summarize the work on the design and implementation of an off-lattice united-residue force field that is underway in our group, in cooperation with Professor HA. Scheraga of Cornell University, U.S.A.},

  Abstract = {One of the most important and challenging tasks in protein modelling is the prediction of loops, as can be seen in the large variety of existing approaches. Loops In Proteins (LIP) is a database that includes all protein segments of a length up to 15 residues contained in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). In this study, the applicability of LIP to loop prediction in the framework of homology modelling is investigated. Searching the database for loop candidates takes less than 1 s on a desktop PC, and ranking them takes a few minutes. This is an order of magnitude faster than most existing procedures. The measure of accuracy is the root mean square deviation (RMSD) with respect to the main-chain atoms after local superposition of target loop and predicted loop. Loops of up to nine residues length were modelled with a local RMSD <1 A and those of length up to 14 residues with an accuracy better than 2 A. The results were compared in detail with a thoroughly evaluated and tested ab initio method published recently and additionally with two further methods for a small loop test set. The LIP method produced very good predictions. In particular for longer loops it outperformed other methods.},

  Abstract = {Gamma-turns may be defined by a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl group of one amino acid residue and the amino group of the acid two residues ahead in the sequence. They occur as two types, inverse gamma-turns and classic gamma-turns (classic gamma-turns are usually called just gamma-turns but we prefer to add the adjective classic to distinguish them from the word gamma-turn, referring collectively to both). Of the two, classic gamma-turns are less common and are considered by all authors to be extreme rarities in proteins. However, we find that a number do occur in a sample of proteins of known three-dimensional structure. One occurs at the edge of the second hypervariable region of the light chain in some immunoglobulins. All classic gamma-turns except one are associated with a reversal in the main chain direction. In most cases, the turn lies at the loop end of a beta-hairpin. By contrast, inverse gamma-turns, although giving rise to a kink in the chain, rarely occur within beta-hairpins and are seldom situated at a position of reversal, by 180 degrees, in chain direction.},

  Abstract = {Beta-bulges have been described as common irregularities in antiparallel beta-sheets. The two commonest kinds are described as 'classic' and 'G1'. The G1-type is often observed to occur at the loop end of beta-hairpins. I confirm this but also find that the characteristic G1 beta-bulge features (hydrogen bonds and dihedral angles) are found, in some loops, in the absence of any adjacent antiparallel beta-hairpin, so that the beta-bulge is effectively acting as a new sort of turn. Also I show that G1 beta-bulge loops occur in a number of different structural forms, some of which have not been described in detail before. G1 beta-bulge loops are common features; on average, a half of all proteins have one.},

  Abstract = {A common feature of alpha-helices in proteins is a loop at the C-terminal end, with a characteristic hydrogen bond pattern. It is noted that several loops with the same structural features occur independently of alpha-helices; two are even situated at the loop ends of beta-hairpins. The name paperclip is suggested for loops possessing the appropriate hydrogen bonds. A number of features of paperclips are described: they exist in two classes, depending on the number of residues at the loop end; one class is very much commoner than the other. Two paperclips are found that belong to the common class, except that the main-chain conformation of each is the mirror image of that normally found. The majority of paperclips are shown to have tightly clustered sets of main-chain dihedral angles. These are somewhat similar to, but distinct from, a subgroup of another common family of loops that have been called beta-bulge loops; in the latter, the dihedral angles are also tightly clustered. The high degree of clustering in both cases is likely to be a result of steric constraints associated with hydrogen bond patterns at the ends of loops.},

Sibanda & Thornton [(1985) Nature (London) 316, 170-174] have classified beta-hairpins as either two-residue, three-residue, four-residue etc., loops. We point out that their nomenclature, by itself, gives rise to ambiguities, but that, if the class (one of the four mentioned above) is also specified, the description of beta-hairpins becomes straightforward. A range of proteins of known three-dimensional structure has been examined; it provides examples of hairpins of each of the four classes and give some indication of their frequency of occurrence. The distribution observed is substantially different from that described by Sibanda & Thornton [(1985) Nature (London) 316, 170-174].},

During this period, there has been substantial progress in both comparative modeling of structure (using information from an evolutionarily related structural template) and template-free modeling. The quality of comparative models depends on the closeness of the evolutionary relationship on which they are based. Template-free modeling, although still very approximate, now produces topologically near correct models for some small proteins. Current major challenges are refining comparative models so that they match experimental accuracy, obtaining accurate sequence alignments for models based on remote evolutionary relationships, and extending template-free modeling methods so that they produce more accurate models, handle parts of comparative models not available from a template and deal with larger structures.},

  Abstract = {The feasibility of determining the conformation of segments of a polypeptide chain up to six residues in length in globular proteins by means of a systematic search through the possible conformations has been investigated. Trial conformations are generated by using representative sets of phi, psi, and chi angles that have been derived from an examination of the distributions of these angles in refined protein structures. A set of filters based on simple rules that protein structures obey is used to reduce the number of conformations to a manageable total. The most important filters are the maintenance of chain integrity and the avoidance of too-short van der Waals contacts with the rest of the protein and with other portions of the segment under construction. The procedure is intended to be used with approximate models so that allowance is made throughout for errors in the rest of the structure. All possible main chains are first constructed and then all possible side-chain conformations are built onto each of these. The electrostatic energy, including a solvent screening term, and the exposed hydrophobic area are evaluated for each accepted conformation. The method has been tested on two segments of chain in the trypsin like enzyme from Streptomyces griseus. It is found that there is a wide spread of energies among the accepted conformations, and the lowest energy ones have satisfactorily small root mean square deviations from the X-ray structure.},

There are 15, 20, 18 and 6 minima that are possible for the four cases respectively and these fall into 11 different groups. A study of these minima shows that, (i) some minima contain hydrogen bonds--either 4-->1 or 1-->2 type, (ii) the low energy minima qualify themselves as bend conformations, (iii) cis' and trans' conformations are possible for the prolyl residue as also the C gamma-endo and C gamma-exo puckerings, and (iv) for Pro-cis-Pro, cis' at the first prolyl residue is ruled out, due to the high energy. The available crystal structure data on proteins and peptides, containing cis-Pro segment have been examined with a view to find the minima that occur in solid state. The data from protein show that they fall under two groups. The conformation at X in X-cis-Pro is near extended when it is a non-glycyl residue. In both peptides and proteins there exists a preference for trans' conformation at prolyl residue over cis' when X is a non-glycyl residue. The minima obtained can be useful in modelling studies.},

  Abstract = {Conformational clusters and consensus sequences for protein loops have been derived by computational analysis of their structures in a non-redundant set of 233 proteins with less than 25\% sequence homology (X-ray resolution better than 2.5 A). Loops have been classified into five types (alpha-alpha, beta-beta links, beta-beta hairpins, alpha-beta and beta-alpha) according to the secondary structures they embrace. Four variables have been used to describe the loop geometry, three angles and one distance between the secondary structure elements embracing the loop. Ramachandran angles (phi, psi) are used to define the loop conformations within each brace geometry. All loops from the non-redundant set have been clustered by means of these geometric features. A total of 56 classes (9 alpha-alpha, 11 beta-beta links, 14 beta-beta hairpins, 13 alpha-beta and 9 beta-alpha) were identified with consensus Ramachandran angles in the loops. These classes were divided into subclasses based on the brace geometry. This clustering procedure captures most of the clusters analysed by predominantly visual inspection methods and finds other clusters that have hitherto not been described. Consensus sequence patterns were identified for the subclasses. An extensive characterisation of loop conformations has therefore been achieved and the computational approach is readily open to the incorporation of information from newly determined structures. These clusters should also enhance model building by comparison studies.},

  Abstract = {A computer-based algorithm was used to cluster the loops forming the complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 of the heavy chain (H3) into canonical classes. Previous analyses of the three-dimensional structures of CDR loops (also known as the hypervariable regions) within antibody immunoglobulin variable domains have shown that for five of the six CDRs there are only a few main-chain conformations (known as canonical forms) that show clear relationships between sequence and structure. However, the larger variation in length and conformation of loops within H3 has limited the classification of these loops into canonical forms. The clustering procedure presented here is based on aligning the Ramachandran-coded main-chain conformation of the residues using a dynamic algorithm that allows the insertion of gaps to obtain an optimum alignment. A total of 41 H3 loops out of 62 non-identical loops, extracted from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, have been automatically grouped into 22 clusters. Inspection of the clusters for consensus sequences or intra-loop interactions or invariant conformation led to the proposal of 13 canonical forms representing 31 loops. These canonical forms include a consideration of the geometry of both the take-off region adjacent to the bracing beta-strands and the remaining loop apex. Subsequently a new set of 15 H3 loops not included in the initial analysis was considered. The clustering procedure was repeated and nine of these 15 loops could be assigned to original clusters, including seven to canonical forms. A sequence profile was generated for each canonical form from the original set of loops and matched against the sequences of the new H3 loops. For five out of the seven new H3 loops that were in a canonical form, the correct form was identified at first rank by this predictive scheme.},

  Abstract = {The treatment of hydration effects in protein dynamics simulations varies in model complexity and spans the range from the computationally intensive microscopic evaluation to simple dielectric screening of charge-charge interactions. This paper compares different solvent models applied to the problem of estimating the free-energy difference between two loop conformations in acetylcholinesterase. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to sample potential energy surfaces of the two basins with solvent treated by means of explicit and implicit methods. Implicit solvent methods studied include the generalized Born (GB) model, atomic solvation potential (ASP), and the distance-dependent dieletric constant. By using the linear response approximation (LRA), the explicit solvent calculations determined a free-energy difference that is in excellent agreement with the experimental estimate, while rescoring the protein conformations with GB or the Poisson equation showed inconsistent and inferior results. While the approach of rescoring conformations from explicit water simulations with implicit solvent models is popular among many applications, it perturbs the energy landscape by changing the solvent contribution to microstates without conformational relaxation, thus leading to non-optimal solvation free energies. Calculations applying MD with a GB solvent model produced results of comparable accuracy as observed with LRA, yet the electrostatic free-energy terms were significantly different due to optimization on a potential energy surface favored by an implicit solvent reaction field. The simpler methods of ASP and the distance-dependent scaling of the dielectric constant both produced considerable distortions in the protein internal free-energy terms and are consequently unreliable.},

  Note = {0969-2126

  Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein evolution gives rise to families of structurally related proteins, within which sequence identities can be extremely low. As a result, structure-based classifications can be effective at identifying unanticipated relationships in known structures and in optimal cases function can also be assigned. The ever increasing number of known protein structures is too large to classify all proteins manually, therefore, automatic methods are needed for fast evaluation of protein structures. RESULTS: We present a semi-automatic procedure for deriving a novel hierarchical classification of protein domain structures (CATH). The four main levels of our classification are protein class (C), architecture (A), topology (T) and homologous superfamily (H). Class is the simplest level, and it essentially describes the secondary structure composition of each domain. In contrast, architecture summarises the shape revealed by the orientations of the secondary structure units, such as barrels and sandwiches. At the topology level, sequential connectivity is considered, such that members of the same architecture might have quite different topologies. When structures belonging to the same T-level have suitably high similarities combined with similar functions, the proteins are assumed to be evolutionarily related and put into the same homologous superfamily. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the structural families generated by CATH reveals the prominent features of protein structure space. We find that nearly a third of the homologous superfamilies (H-levels) belong to ten major T-levels, which we call superfolds, and furthermore that nearly two-thirds of these H-levels cluster into nine simple architectures. A database of well-characterised protein structure families, such as CATH, will facilitate the assignment of structure-function/evolution relationships to both known and newly determined protein structures.},

  Abstract = {The local environment of an amino acid in a folded protein determines the acceptability of mutations at that position. In order to characterize and quantify these structural constraints, we have made a comparative analysis of families of homologous proteins. Residues in each structure are classified according to amino acid type, secondary structure, accessibility of the side chain, and existence of hydrogen bonds from the side chains. Analysis of the pattern of observed substitutions as a function of local environment shows that there are distinct patterns, especially for buried polar residues. The substitution data tables are available on diskette with Protein Science. Given the fold of a protein, one is able to predict sequences compatible with the fold (profiles or templates) and potentially to discriminate between a correctly folded and misfolded protein. Conversely, analysis of residue variation across a family of aligned sequences in terms of substitution profiles can allow prediction of secondary structure or tertiary environment.},

  Abstract = {The prediction of protein structure depends on the quality of the models used. In this paper, we examine the relationship between the complexity and accuracy of representation of various models of protein alpha-carbon backbone structure. First, we develop an efficient algorithm for the near optimal fitting of arbitrary lattice and off-lattice models of polypeptide chains to their true X-ray structures. Using this, we show that the relationship between the complexity of a model, taken as the number of possible conformational states per residue, and the simplest measure of accuracy, the root-mean-square deviation from the X-ray structure, is approximately (Accuracy) varies; is directly proportional to (Complexity)-1/2. This relationship is insensitive to the particularities of individual models, i.e. lattice and off-lattice models of the same complexity tend to have similar average root-mean-square deviations, and this also implies that improvements in model accuracy with increasing complexity are very small. However, other measures of model accuracy, such as the preservation of X-ray residue-residue contacts and the alpha-helix, do distinguish among models. In addition, we show that low complexity models, which take into account the uneven distribution of residue conformations in real proteins, can represent X-ray structures as accurately as more complex models, which do not: a selected 6-state model can represent protein structures almost as accurately (1.7 A root-mean-square) as a 17-state lattice model (1.6 A root-mean-square). Finally, we use a novel optimization procedure to generate eight 4-state models, which fit native proteins to an average of 2.4 A, and preserve 85\% of native residue-residue contacts. We discuss the implications of these findings for protein folding and the prediction of protein conformation.},

  Abstract = {The CATH database of protein domain structures (http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/cath/) currently contains 43,229 domains classified into 1467 superfamilies and 5107 sequence families. Each structural family is expanded with sequence relatives from GenBank and completed genomes, using a variety of efficient sequence search protocols and reliable thresholds. This extended CATH protein family database contains 616,470 domain sequences classified into 23,876 sequence families. This results in the significant expansion of the CATH HMM model library to include models built from the CATH sequence relatives, giving a 10\% increase in coverage for detecting remote homologues. An improved Dictionary of Homologous superfamilies (DHS) (http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/dhs/) containing specific sequence, structural and functional information for each superfamily in CATH considerably assists manual validation of homologues. Information on sequence relatives in CATH superfamilies, GenBank and completed genomes is presented in the CATH associated DHS and Gene3D resources. Domain partnership information can be obtained from Gene3D (http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/cath/Gene3D/). A new CATH server has been implemented (http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cath/CathServer.pl) providing automatic classification of newly determined sequences and structures using a suite of rapid sequence and structure comparison methods. The statistical significance of matches is assessed and links are provided to the putative superfamily or fold group to which the query sequence or structure is assigned.},

  Abstract = {Limitations in protein homology modeling often arise from the inability to adequately model loops. In this paper we focus on the selection of loop conformations. We present a complete computational treatment that allows the screening of loop conformations to identify those that best fit a molecular model. The stability of a loop in a protein is evaluated via computations of conformational free energies in solution, i.e., the free energy difference between the reference structure and the modeled one. A thermodynamic cycle is used for calculation of the conformational free energy, in which the total free energy of the reference state (i.e., gas phase) is the CHARMm potential energy. The electrostatic contribution of the solvation free energy is obtained from solving the finite-difference Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The nonpolar contribution is based on a surface area-based expression. We applied this computational scheme to a simple but well-characterized system, the antibody hypervariable loop (complementarity-determining region, CDR). Instead of creating loop conformations, we generated a database of loops extracted from high-resolution crystal structures of proteins, which display geometrical similarities with antibody CDRs. We inserted loops from our database into a framework of an antibody; then we calculated the conformational free energies of each loop. Results show that we successfully identified loops with a reference-like CDR geometry, with the lowest conformational free energy in gas phase only. Surprisingly, the solvation energy term plays a confusing role, sometimes discriminating reference-like CDR geometry and many times allowing non-reference-like conformations to have the lowest conformational free energies (for short loops). Most reference-like loop conformations are separated from others by a gap in the gas phase conformational free energy scale. Naturally, loops from antibody molecules are found to be the best models for long CDRs (> or = 6 residues), mainly because of a better packing of backbone atoms into the framework of the antibody model.},

  Abstract = {We propose a novel Metropolis Monte Carlo procedure for protein modeling and analyze the influence of hydrogen bonding on the distribution of polyalanine conformations. We use an atomistic model of the polyalanine chain with rigid and planar polypeptide bonds, and elastic alpha carbon valence geometry. We adopt a simplified energy function in which only hard-sphere repulsion and hydrogen bonding interactions between the atoms are considered. Our Metropolis Monte Carlo procedure utilizes local crankshaft moves and is combined with parallel tempering to exhaustively sample the conformations of 16-mer polyalanine. We confirm that Flory's isolated-pair hypothesis (the steric independence between the dihedral angles of individual amino acids) does not hold true in long polypeptide chains. In addition to 3(10)- and alpha-helices, we identify a kink stabilized by 2 hydrogen bonds with a shared acceptor as a common structural motif. Varying the strength of hydrogen bonds, we induce the helix-coil transition in the model polypeptide chain. We compare the propensities for various hydrogen bonding patterns and determine the degree of cooperativity of hydrogen bond formation in terms of the Hill coefficient. The observed helix-coil transition is also quantified according to Zimm-Bragg theory.},

  Abstract = {The i + 5-->i hydrogen bonded turn conformation (pi-turn) with the fifth residue adopting alpha L conformation is frequently found at the C-terminus of helices in proteins and hence is speculated to be a helix termination signal. An analysis of the occurrence of i + 5-->i hydrogen bonded turn conformation at any general position in proteins (not specifically at the helix C-terminus), using coordinates of 228 protein crystal structures determined by X-ray crystallography to better than 2.5 A resolution is reported in this paper. Of 486 detected pi-turn conformations, 367 have the (i + 4)th residue in alpha L conformation, generally occurring at the C-terminus of alpha-helices, consistent with previous observations. However, a significant number (111) of pi-turn conformations occur with (i + 4)th residue in alpha R conformation also, generally occurring in alpha-helices as distortions either at the terminii or at the middle, a novel finding. These two sets of pi-turn conformations are referred to by the names pi alpha L and pi alpha R-turns, respectively, depending upon whether the (i + 4)th residue adopts alpha L or alpha R conformations. Four pi-turns, named pi alpha L'-turns, were noticed to be mirror images of pi alpha L-turns, and four more pi-turns, which have the (i + 4)th residue in beta conformation and denoted as pi beta-turns, occur as a part of hairpin bend connecting twisted beta-strands. Consecutive pi-turns occur, but only with pi alpha R-turns. The preference for amino acid residues is different in pi alpha L and pi alpha R-turns. However, both show a preference for Pro after the C-termini. Hydrophilic residues are preferred at positions i + 1, i + 2, and i + 3 of pi alpha L-turns, whereas positions i and i + 5 prefer hydrophobic residues. Residue i + 4 in pi alpha L-turns is mainly Gly and less often Asn. Although pi alpha R-turns generally occur as distortions in helices, their amino acid preference is different from that of helices. Poor helix formers, such as His, Tyr, and Asn, also were found to be preferred for pi alpha R-turns, whereas good helix former Ala is not preferred. pi-Turns in peptides provide a picture of the pi-turn at atomic resolution. Only nine peptide-based pi-turns are reported so far, and all of them belong to pi alpha L-turn type with an achiral residue in position i + 4. The results are of importance for structure prediction, modeling, and de novo design of proteins.},

In contrast to other approaches predictions are made for loop lengths up to 17 residues. The predictions have been achieved using artificial neural networks which are trained on a large set of loops from the Brookhaven Protein Databank which have structures similar to CDR-H3. The loop structures are described by the two backbone dihedral angles phi and psi for each residue. For 21 CDR-H3 loops unique to the neural network, the prediction of dihedral angles leads to an average root mean square deviation in the Cartesian coordinates of 2.65 A. The present method, when combined with existing modelling protocols, provides an important addition to the structural prediction of the complementarity determining regions of antibodies.},

  Abstract = {We propose a general classification scheme for loops, aperiodic segments of protein structure. In an effort to avoid the geometric complexity created by non-repeating phi psi angles, a morphologic definition that focuses upon the linearity and planarity of loops is utilized. Out of 432 loops (4 to 20 residues in length) extracted from 67 proteins, 205 are classified as linear (straps), 133 as non-linear and planar (omegas), and 86 as non-linear and non-planar (zetas). The remaining 8 are classified as compound loops because they contain a combination of strap, omega, and zeta morphologies. We introduce a structural alphabet as a shorthand notation for describing local conformation. The symbols of this alphabet are based on the virtual dihedral angle joining four consecutive alpha carbons. The notation is used to provide a compact description of loop motifs in phosphate binding and calcium binding proteins. Since similar loop conformations form similar words, the structural sequence facilitates the search for common structural motifs in a family of loops. Contrary to the view of loops as random coils, we find loops to have positional preferences for amino acid residues analogous to those previously described for beta-turns.},

  Abstract = {A major limitation of current comparative modeling methods is the accuracy with which regions that are structurally divergent from homologues of known structure can be modeled. Because structural differences between homologous proteins are responsible for variations in protein function and specificity, the ability to model these differences has important functional consequences. Although existing methods can provide reasonably accurate models of short loop regions, modeling longer structurally divergent regions is an unsolved problem. Here we describe a method based on the de novo structure prediction algorithm, Rosetta, for predicting conformations of structurally divergent regions in comparative models. Initial conformations for short segments are selected from the protein structure database, whereas longer segments are built up by using three- and nine-residue fragments drawn from the database and combined by using the Rosetta algorithm. A gap closure term in the potential in combination with modified Newton's method for gradient descent minimization is used to ensure continuity of the peptide backbone. Conformations of variable regions are refined in the context of a fixed template structure using Monte Carlo minimization together with rapid repacking of side-chains to iteratively optimize backbone torsion angles and side-chain rotamers. For short loops, mean accuracies of 0.69, 1.45, and 3.62 A are obtained for 4, 8, and 12 residue loops, respectively. In addition, the method can provide reasonable models of conformations of longer protein segments: predicted conformations of 3A root-mean-square deviation or better were obtained for 5 of 10 examples of segments ranging from 13 to 34 residues. In combination with a sequence alignment algorithm, this method generates complete, ungapped models of protein structures, including regions both similar to and divergent from a homologous structure. This combined method was used to make predictions for 28 protein domains in the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure 4 (CASP 4) and 59 domains in CASP 5, where the method ranked highly among comparative modeling and fold recognition methods. Model accuracy in these blind predictions is dominated by alignment quality, but in the context of accurate alignments, long protein segments can be accurately modeled. Notably, the method correctly predicted the local structure of a 39-residue insertion into a TIM barrel in CASP 5 target T0186.},

  Abstract = {The most reliable methods for predicting protein structure are by way of homologous extension, using structural information from a closely related protein, or by threading through a set of predefined protein folds (inverse folding). Both sets of methods provide a model for the core of the protein--the structurally conserved secondary structures. Due to the large variability both in sequence and size of the loops that connect these secondary structures, they generally cannot be modeled using these techniques. Loop-closure algorithms are aimed at predicting loop structures, given their end-to-end distance. Various such algorithms have been described, and all have been tested by predicting the structure of a single loop in a known protein. In this paper we propose a method, which is based on the bond-scaling-relaxation loop-closure algorithm, for simultaneously predicting the structures of multiple loops, and demonstrate that, for two spatially close loops, simultaneous closure invariably leads to more accurate predictions than sequential closure. The accuracy of the predictions obtained for pairs of loops in the size range of 5-7 residues each is comparable to that obtained by other methods, when predicting the structures of single loops: the RMS deviations from the native conformations of various test cases modeled are approximately 0.6-1.7 A for backbone atoms and 1.1-3.3 A for all-atoms.},

  Note = {Journal Article},
  Abstract = {Loops are regions of non-repetitive conformation connecting regular secondary structures. They are both the most difficult and error prone regions of a protein to solve by X-ray crystallography and the hardest regions to model using knowledge-based procedures. While the core of a protein can be straight forwardly modelled from the structurally conserved regions of homologues of known structure, loops must be modelled from a selected homologue or from a loop chosen from outside the family. Here we present a loop prediction procedure that attempts to identify the conformational class of the loop rather than to select a specific loop from a database of fragments. The structures of some 2083 loops of one to eight residues in length were extracted from a database of 225 protein and protein domain structures. For each loop, the relative disposition of its bounding secondary structures is described by the separation between the tips of their axes, the angle and dihedral angle between their axes. From the clustering of the loops according to the root mean square deviation of their spatial fit, a total of 162 loop conformational classes, including 79\% of loops, were identified. One-hundred and eight of these, involving 66\% of the loops, were populated by at least four non-homologous loops or four loops sharing a low sequence identity. Another 54 classes, including 13\% of the loops, were populated by at least three loops of low sequence similarity from three or fewer non-homologous groups. Most of the previously described loop conformations were found among the populated classes. For each class a template was constructed containing both sequence preferences and the relative disposition of bounding secondary structures among member loops. During comparative modelling, the conformation of a loop can be predicted by identifying a loop class with which its sequence and disposition of bounding secondary structures are compatible.},

  Abstract = {Loops are regions of non-repetitive conformation connecting regular secondary structures. They are both the most difficult and error prone regions of a protein to solve by X-ray crystallography and the hardest regions to model using comparative procedures. Although a loop can sometimes be modelled from a homologue, very often it must be selected from outside the family. The loop prediction procedure, SLoop, attempts to identify the conformational class of the loop rather than to select a specific loop from a set of fragments extracted from known structures or generated ab initio. Templates are constructed for each of the 161 loop conformational classes that have been identified from the clustering of the structures of some 2024 loops of one to eight residues in length. A class template describes both sequence preferences and relative disposition of bounding secondary structures. During comparative modelling, the conformation of a loop can be predicted by identifying a loop class with which its sequence and disposition of bounding secondary structures are compatible. The procedure is tested on an unrelated non-redundant set of 1785 loops under stringent and lax evaluation schemes. Optimal sequence score cut-offs are identified such that the prediction rate is equal to the percentage of loops assigned to acceptable classes. Under the stringent evaluation, at the optimal sequence score cut-off, a conformation is predicted for 50\% of loops of which 47\% are correct, while under the lax evaluation a conformation is predicted for 63\% of loops of which 54\% are correct. Sequence score is shown to be a good indicator of the probability of a prediction being correct. Loop length also has a strong affect on prediction outcomes. Considering only loops of two to five residues in length, under the stringent evaluation 62\% of loops are predicted with 52\% of these predictions being correct while under the lax evaluation predictions are provided for 75\% of loops of which 57\% are correct.},

  Abstract = {We describe a comparative protein modelling method designed to find the most probable structure for a sequence given its alignment with related structures. The three-dimensional (3D) model is obtained by optimally satisfying spatial restraints derived from the alignment and expressed as probability density functions (pdfs) for the features restrained. For example, the probabilities for main-chain conformations of a modelled residue may be restrained by its residue type, main-chain conformation of an equivalent residue in a related protein, and the local similarity between the two sequences. Several such pdfs are obtained from the correlations between structural features in 17 families of homologous proteins which have been aligned on the basis of their 3D structures. The pdfs restrain C alpha-C alpha distances, main-chain N-O distances, main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles. A smoothing procedure is used in the derivation of these relationships to minimize the problem of a sparse database. The 3D model of a protein is obtained by optimization of the molecular pdf such that the model violates the input restraints as little as possible. The molecular pdf is derived as a combination of pdfs restraining individual spatial features of the whole molecule. The optimization procedure is a variable target function method that applies the conjugate gradients algorithm to positions of all non-hydrogen atoms. The method is automated and is illustrated by the modelling of trypsin from two other serine proteinases.},

  Abstract = {Although relatively rare, the tryptophan residue (Trp), with its large hydrophobic surface, has a unique role in the folded structure and the binding site of many proteins, and its fluorescence properties make it very useful in studying the structures and dynamics of protein molecules in solution. An analysis has been made of its environment and the geometry of its interaction with neighbors using 719 Trp residues in 180 different protein structures. The distribution of the number of partners interacting with the Trp aromatic ring shows a peak at 6 (considering protein residues only) and 8 (including water and substrate molecules also). The means of the solvent-accessible surface areas of the ring show an exponential decrease with the increase in the number of partners; this relationship can be used to assess the efficiency of packing of residues around Trp. Various residues exhibit different propensities of binding the Trp side chain. The aromatic residues, Met and Pro have high values, whereas the smaller and polar-chain residues have weaker propensities. Most of the interactions are with residues far away in sequence, indicating the importance of Trp in stabilizing the tertiary structure. Of all the ring atoms NE1 shows the highest number of interactions, both along the edge (hydrogen bonding) as well as along the face. Various weak but specific interactions, engendering stability to the protein structure, have been identified.},

  Abstract = {Is there value in constructing side chains while searching protein conformational space during an ab initio simulation? If so, what is the most computationally efficient method for constructing these side chains? To answer these questions, four published approaches were used to construct side chain conformations on a range of near-native main chains generated by ab initio protein structure prediction methods. The accuracy of these approaches was compared with a naive approach that selects the most frequently observed rotamer for a given amino acid to construct side chains. An all-atom conditional probability discriminatory function is useful at selecting conformations with overall low all-atom root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) and the discrimination improves on sets that are closer to the native conformation. In addition, the naive approach performs as well as more sophisticated methods in terms of the percentage of chi(1) angles built accurately and the all-atom r. m.s.d., between the native and near-native conformations. The results suggest that the naive method would be extremely useful for fast and efficient side chain construction on vast numbers of conformations for ab initio prediction of protein structure.},

  Abstract = {The interconnected nature of interactions in protein structures appears to be the major hurdle in preventing the construction of accurate comparative models. We present an algorithm that uses graph theory to handle this problem. Each possible conformation of a residue in an amino acid sequence is represented using the notion of a node in a graph. Each node is given a weight based on the degree of the interaction between its side-chain atoms and the local main-chain atoms. Edges are then drawn between pairs of residue conformations/nodes that are consistent with each other (i.e. clash-free and satisfying geometrical constraints). The edges are weighted based on the interactions between the atoms of the two nodes. Once the entire graph is constructed, all the maximal sets of completely connected nodes (cliques) are found using a clique-finding algorithm. The cliques with the best weights represent the optimal combinations of the various main-chain and side-chain possibilities, taking the respective environments into account. The algorithm is used in a comparative modeling scenario to build side-chains, regions of main chain, and mix and match between different homologs in a context-sensitive manner. The predictive power of this method is assessed by applying it to cases where the experimental structure is not known in advance.},

  Abstract = {As part of the third Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction meeting (CASP3), we predict the three-dimensional structures for 13 proteins using a hierarchical approach. First, all possible compact conformations of a protein sequence are enumerated using a highly simplified tetrahedral lattice model. We select a large subset of these conformations using a lattice-based scoring function and build detailed all-atom models incorporating predicted secondary structure. A combined all-atom knowledge-based scoring function is then used to select three smaller subsets from these all-atom models. Finally, a consensus-based distance geometry procedure is used to generate the best conformations from each of the all-atom subsets. With this method, we are able to predict the global topology/shape for all or a large part of the sequence for six out of the thirteen proteins. For two other proteins, the topology/shape for shorter fragments are predicted. This represents a marked improvement in ab initio prediction since CASP was first instigated in 1994.},

The theoretical foundations and the development of a suitable empirical all-atom potential energy function and a global optimization search are examined. Whereas the all-atom approach has thus far succeeded for relatively small molecules and for alpha-helical proteins containing up to 46 residues, it has been necessary to develop a hierarchical approach to treat larger proteins. In the hierarchical approach to single- and multiple-chain proteins, global optimization is carried out for a simplified united residue (UNRES) description of a polypeptide chain to locate the region in which the global minimum lies. Conversion of the UNRES structures in this region to all-atom structures is followed by a local search in this region. The performance of this approach in successive CASP blind tests for predicting protein structure by an ab initio physics-based method is described. Finally, a recent attempt to compute a folding pathway is discussed.},

  Abstract = {We compare the modelling accuracy of two common rotamer libraries, the Dunbrack-Cohen and the 'Penultimate' rotamer libraries, with that of a novel library of discrete side chain conformations extracted from the Protein Data Bank. These side chain conformer libraries are extracted automatically from high-quality protein structures using stringent filters and maintain crystallographic bond lengths and angles. This contrasts with traditional rotamer libraries defined in terms of chi angles under the assumption of idealized covalent geometry. We demonstrate that side chain modelling onto native and near-native main chain conformations is significantly more successful with the conformer libraries than with the rotamer libraries when solely considering excluded-volume interactions. The rotamer libraries are inadequate to model side chains without atomic clashes on over 20\% of targets if the backbone is held fixed in the native conformation. An algorithm is described for simultaneously modelling both main chain and side chain atoms during discrete ab initio sampling. The resulting models have equivalent root mean square deviations from the experimentally determined protein loops as models from backbone-only ensembles, indicating that all-atom modelling does not detract from the accuracy of conformational sampling.},

We find that the 'tight' beta-hairpins, classified by the length and conformations of their loop regions, form distinct families and that the loop regions of the family members have sequences which are characteristic of that family. The two-residue hairpin loops include almost entirely I' or II' beta-turns, in contrast to the general preference for type I and type II turns. These findings are being used to help define templates or consensus sequences to be incorporated into our existing supersecondary structure prediction algorithm.

  Abstract = {To generate structures consistent with both the local and nonlocal interactions responsible for protein stability, 3 and 9 residue fragments of known structures with local sequences similar to the target sequence were assembled into complete tertiary structures using a Monte Carlo simulated annealing procedure (Simons et al., J Mol Biol 1997; 268:209-225). The scoring function used in the simulated annealing procedure consists of sequence-dependent terms representing hydrophobic burial and specific pair interactions such as electrostatics and disulfide bonding and sequence-independent terms representing hard sphere packing, alpha-helix and beta-strand packing, and the collection of beta-strands in beta-sheets (Simons et al., Proteins 1999;34:82-95). For each of 21 small, ab initio targets, 1,200 final structures were constructed, each the result of 100,000 attempted fragment substitutions. The five structures submitted for the CASP III experiment were chosen from the approximately 25 structures with the lowest scores in the broadest minima (assessed through the number of structural neighbors; Shortle et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1998;95:1158-1162). The results were encouraging: highlights of the predictions include a 99-residue segment for MarA with an rmsd of 6.4 A to the native structure, a 95-residue (full length) prediction for the EH2 domain of EPS15 with an rmsd of 6.0 A, a 75-residue segment of DNAB helicase with an rmsd of 4.7 A, and a 67-residue segment of ribosomal protein L30 with an rmsd of 3.8 A. These results suggest that ab initio methods may soon become useful for low-resolution structure prediction for proteins that lack a close homologue of known structure.},

  Journal = {Pac Symp Biocomput},

  Note = {Journal Article},
  Abstract = {When searching for an optimal protein structure, it is often necessary to generate a set of structures similar, e.g., within 4A Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), to some base structure. Current methods to do this are designed to produce only small deviations (< 0.1A RMSD) and are inefficient for larger deviations. The method proposed in this paper, ChainTweak, can generate conformations with larger deviations from the base much more efficiently. For example, in 18 seconds it can generate 100 backbone conformations, each within 1-4A RMSD of a given 45-residue conformation. Moreover, each conformation has correct bond lengths, angles and omega torsional angles; its phi-psi angles have energetically favorable values; and there are rarely any backbone steric clashes. The method uses the insight that loop closure techniques can be used to perform compensatory changes of dihedral angles so that only a part of the conformation is changed. It is demonstrated, using decoys from the Decoys 'R Us data-set, that ChainTweak can be used to construct good decoys. It also provides a novel and intuitive way of analyzing the energy landscape of a protein. In addition, ChainTweak can improve the accuracy and performance of the loop modeling program RAPPER by an order of magnitude (1.1 min. vs. 36 min. for an 8-residue chain).},

  Abstract = {We present a prototype of a new approach to the folding problem of polypeptide chains. This approach is based on the analysis of known protein structures. It derives the energy potentials for the atomic interactions of all amino acid residue pairs as a function of the distance between the involved atoms. These potentials are then used to calculate the energies of all conformations that exist in the data base with respect to a given sequence. Then, by using only the most stable conformations, clusters of the most probable conformations for the given sequence are obtained. To discuss the results properly we introduce a new classification of segments based on their conformational stability. Special care is taken to allow for sparse data sets. The use of the method is demonstrated in the discussion of the identical oligopeptide sequences found in different conformations in unrelated proteins. VNTFV, for example, adopts a beta-strand in ribonuclease but it is found in an alpha-helical conformation in erythrocruorin. In the case of VNTFV the ensemble obtained consists of a single cluster of beta-strand conformations, indicating that this may be the preferred conformation for the pentapeptide. When the flanking residues are included in the calculation the hepapeptide P-VNTFV-H (ribonuclease) again yields an ensemble of beta-strands. However, in the ensemble of D-VNTFV-A (erythrocruorin) the major cluster is of alpha-helical type. In the present study we concentrate on the local aspects of protein conformations. However, the theory presented is quite general and not restricted to oligopeptides. We indicate extensions of the approach to the calculation of global conformations of proteins as well as conceivable applications to a number of molecular systems.},

  Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ability to predict the native conformation of a globular protein from its amino-acid sequence is an important unsolved problem of molecular biology. We have previously reported a method in which reduced representations of proteins are folded on a lattice by Monte Carlo simulation, using statistically-derived potentials. When applied to sequences designed to fold into four-helix bundles, this method generated predicted conformations closely resembling the real ones. RESULTS: We now report a hierarchical approach to protein-structure prediction, in which two cycles of the above-mentioned lattice method (the second on a finer lattice) are followed by a full-atom molecular dynamics simulation. The end product of the simulations is thus a full-atom representation of the predicted structure. The application of this procedure to the 60 residue, B domain of staphylococcal protein A predicts a three-helix bundle with a backbone root mean square (rms) deviation of 2.25-3 A from the experimentally determined structure. Further application to a designed, 120 residue monomeric protein, mROP, based on the dimeric ROP protein of Escherichia coli, predicts a left turning, four-helix bundle native state. Although the ultimate assessment of the quality of this prediction awaits the experimental determination of the mROP structure, a comparison of this structure with the set of equivalent residues in the ROP dime- crystal structure indicates that they have a rms deviation of approximately 3.6-4.2 A. CONCLUSION: Thus, for a set of helical proteins that have simple native topologies, the native folds of the proteins can be predicted with reasonable accuracy from their sequences alone. Our approach suggest a direction for future work addressing the protein-folding problem.},

  Abstract = {One of the most important unsolved problems of computational biology is prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. In practice, the solution to the protein folding problem demands that two interrelated problems be simultaneously addressed. Potentials that recognize the native state from the myriad of misfolded conformations are required, and the multiple minima conformational search problem must be solved. A means of partly surmounting both problems is to use reduced protein models and knowledge-based potentials. Such models have been employed to elucidate a number of general features of protein folding, including the nature of the energy landscape, the factors responsible for the uniqueness of the native state and the origin of the two-state thermodynamic behavior of globular proteins. Reduced models have also been used to predict protein tertiary and quaternary structure. When combined with a limited amount of experimental information about secondary and tertiary structure, molecules of substantial complexity can be assembled. If predicted secondary structure and tertiary restraints are employed, low resolution models of single domain proteins can be successfully predicted. Thus, simplified protein models have played an important role in furthering the understanding of the physical properties of proteins.},

  Abstract = {In this paper we discuss the problem of including solvation free energies in evaluating the relative stabilities of loops in proteins. A conformational search based on a gas-phase potential function is used to generate a large number of trial conformations. As has been found previously, the energy minimization step in this process tends to pack charged and polar side chains against the protein surface, resulting in conformations which are unstable in the aqueous phase. Various solvation models can easily identify such structures. In order to provide a more severe test of solvation models, gas-phase conformations were generated in which side chains were kept extended so as to maximize their interaction with the solvent. The free energies of these conformations were compared to that calculated for the crystal structure in three loops of the protein E. coli RNase H, with lengths of 7, 8, and 9 residues. Free energies were evaluated with a finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann (FDPB) calculation for electrostatics and a surface area-based term for nonpolar contributions. These were added to a gas-phase potential function. A free energy function based on atomic solvation parameters was also tested. Both functions were quite successful in selecting, based on a free energy criterion, conformations quite close to the crystal structure for two of the three loops. For one loop, which is involved in crystal contacts, conformations that are quite different from the crystal structure were also selected. A method to avoid precision problems associated with using the FDPB method to evaluate conformational free energies in proteins is described.},

  Abstract = {A method was developed to identify compensating changes between residues at positions in a multiple sequence alignment. (For example, one position might always contain a positively charged residue when the other is negatively charged and vice versa.) A correlation-based method was used to measure the compensation found in the four residues at a pair of positions in any two sequences in a multiple alignment. All possible sequence pairings were measured at the pair of positions and the resulting matrix analysed to give a measure of cooperativity among the pairs. The basic method was sufficiently flexible to consider a number of amino acid relatedness models based both on scalar and vectorial properties. Pairs of compensating positions were selected by the method and their mean separation (in a protein of known structure) was compared to both the mean pairwise separation over all residues and the pairwise separation over an equivalent sample of pairs of residues selected on the basis of their conservation alone. The latter is an important control that has been omitted from previous studies. The results indicated that, at best, there was a slight effect (of marginal significance) leading to the selection of closer pairs by the compensation measure when compared to the mean of all pairs. However, this was never as good as the simpler measure based on conservation alone, which always found a significant majority of proteins with a sample mean less than the overall mean.},

  Abstract = {The sensitivity of the commonly used progressive multiple sequence alignment method has been greatly improved for the alignment of divergent protein sequences. Firstly, individual weights are assigned to each sequence in a partial alignment in order to down-weight near-duplicate sequences and up-weight the most divergent ones. Secondly, amino acid substitution matrices are varied at different alignment stages according to the divergence of the sequences to be aligned. Thirdly, residue-specific gap penalties and locally reduced gap penalties in hydrophilic regions encourage new gaps in potential loop regions rather than regular secondary structure. Fourthly, positions in early alignments where gaps have been opened receive locally reduced gap penalties to encourage the opening up of new gaps at these positions. These modifications are incorporated into a new program, CLUSTAL W which is freely available.},

  Abstract = {Over the past few years the possible occurrence of intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded structures in linear and cyclic peptides has attracted increasing attention. In this review emphasis is given to solid-state studies, particularly by X-ray diffraction and infrared absorption techniques. Conformational energy calculations are also considered. The discussion is focused both on model peptides and biological activity polypeptide molecules. The tetrapeptide system (Formula: see text), examined allows one to discuss the extended C5 structure and the various folded conformations, namely the C7 (gamma-turn), C8, C10 (beta-turn), C11, and C13 conformations. The four latter forms may include cis peptide configurations. The oxy-analogs to the C7, C10, and C13 conformations and structures containing bifurcated hydrogen bonds are also discussed. The last sections describe intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded peptide structures involving: (1) a side-chain group, (2) the N-protecting group (in synthetic model compounds), and (3) a beta-amino acid.},

  Abstract = {Conformationally constrained environment-dependent amino acid residue substitution tables have been constructed from a database comprising 33 homologous families of protein sequences aligned on the basis of their three-dimensional structures. Residues are allotted to one of 216 (or 54) classes of combinations of structural features. These include nine main-chain conformation classes, three classes of side-chain accessibility and eight (or two) classes of side-chain involvement in three types of hydrogen bond. Seven different main-chain conformational classes outside of regions of regular structure were identified in an analysis of the distributions of phi-psi torsion angles in 84 high-resolution crystallographic structures. Residue substitutions at equivalent positions in the structural alignments are included where the main-chain conformational class is conserved. Frequency data in the form of 216 (or 54) environment specific (20 x 20 residue type) matrices are then converted to probabilities. Two smoothing regimes incorporating entropy-driven weights were applied to the set of 54 tables. Predicted residue substitutions have been generated for individual residue positions in beta-hairpins and the hypervariable regions of the immunoglobulins. These have been compared with the observed sequence variation at the same positions using rank correlation methods. Measurements of chi 2 distances demonstrate the considerable improvement in predictive power at key residue positions identified from interactive graphics studies when compared to the Dayhoff MDM250 mutation matrix. An illustrative example is given of an application of the method in the ranking of loop fragments in model building studies of structurally variable regions in two subtilisins. A combined template scoring procedure is found to be 26-fold more discriminatory than the Dayhoff matrix. The success rate is approximately 85\%.},

The algorithm is based on a divide and conquer approach and uses a database of precalculated look-up tables, which represent a large set of possible conformations for loop segments of variable length. The target loop is recursively decomposed until the resulting conformations are small enough to be compiled analytically. The algorithm, which is not restricted to any specific loop length, generates a ranked set of loop conformations in 20-180 s on a desktop PC. The prediction quality is evaluated in terms of global RMSD. Depending on loop length the top prediction varies between 1.06 A RMSD for three-residue loops and 3.72 A RMSD for eight-residue loops. Due to its speed the method may also be useful to generate alternative starting conformations for complex simulations.},

  Abstract = {An approach to loop prediction that starts with a database search is presented and analyzed. To obtain meaningful statistics, 130 loops from 21 proteins were studied. The correlation between the internal conformation of the loop and the conformation of the neighboring stem residues was examined. Distances between C(alpha) and C(beta) of the immediate neighbor residues at each end select template loops as well as more complex (e.g. three residues on either side) matching criteria. To have a high probability that the best possible loop candidate in the database is included in the set, relatively large cutoffs for matching the interatomic distances of the stem residues have to be used in the template loop selection procedure; for loops of length 5, this results in an average of 1000 loops and for loops of length 9, the number is about 1500. The required number increases only slowly with loop length, in contrast to the exponential time increase involved in direct searches of the conformational space. The best loops among the large number of candidates can be determined by ranking them with the standard CHARMM non-bonded energy function (without electrostatics) applied to the backbone and C(beta) atoms. The same representation (backbone plus C(beta)) can be used to optimize the loop orientations relative to the rest of the protein by constrained energy minimization. Target loops that have many non-bonded contacts with the protein yield better results so that analysis of the non-bonded contacts of the selected template loops is useful in determining the expected accuracy of a prediction. The method for loop selection and optimization predicted eight (out of 18) loops of up to nine residues to an RMSD better than 1.07 A relative to the crystal structure; for 17 of the 18 loops, one of the three lowest energy template loops had an RMSD of less than 1.79 A. The prediction of antibody loops from a database search is more effective than that for non-antibody loops. Provided that they belong to one of the canonical classes, very similar antibody loops are certain to exist in the database. Superposition of the stem residues for antibody loops also results in a better orientation than with arbitrary target loops because the neighboring residues tend to have a more similar beta-strand structure. Two H3 loops (for which no canonical structures have been proposed) were predicted with reasonable accuracy (RMSD of 0.49 A and 1.07 A) even though no corresponding antibody loops were in the database.},

  Abstract = {PISCES is a database server for producing lists of sequences from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using a number of entry- and chain-specific criteria and mutual sequence identity. Our goal in culling the PDB is to provide the longest list possible of the highest resolution structures that fulfill the sequence identity and structural quality cut-offs. The new PISCES server uses a combination of PSI-BLAST and structure-based alignments to determine sequence identities. Structure alignment produces more complete alignments and therefore more accurate sequence identities than PSI-BLAST. PISCES now allows a user to cull the PDB by-entry in addition to the standard culling by individual chains. In this scenario, a list will contain only entries that do not have a chain that has a sequence identity to any chain in any other entry in the list over the sequence identity cut-off. PISCES also provides fully annotated sequences including gene name and species. The server allows a user to cull an input list of entries or chains, so that other criteria, such as function, can be used. Results from a search on the re-engineered RCSB's site for the PDB can be entered into the PISCES server by a single click, combining the powerful searching abilities of the PDB with PISCES's utilities for sequence culling. The server's data are updated weekly. The server is available at http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/pisces.},

  Abstract = {The prediction of loop regions in the process of protein structure prediction by homology is still an unsolved problem. In an earlier publication, we could show that the correct placement of the amino acids serving as an anchor group to be connected by a loop fragment with a predicted geometry is a highly important step and an essential requirement within the process (Lessel and Schomburg, Proteins 1999; 37:56-64). In this article, we present an analysis of the quality of possible loop predictions with respect to gap length, fragment length, amino acid type, secondary structure, and solvent accessibility. For 550 insertions and 544 deletions, we test all possible positions for anchor groups with an inserted loop of a length between 3 and 12 amino acids. We could show that approximately 80\% of the indel regions could be predicted within 1.5 A RMSD from a knowledge-based loop data base if criteria for the correct localization of anchor groups could be found and the loops can be sorted correctly. From our analysis, several conclusions regarding the optimal placement of anchor groups become obvious: (1) The correct placement of anchor groups is even more important for longer gap lengths, (2) medium length fragments (length 5-8) perform better than short or long ones, (3) the placement of anchor groups at hydrophobic amino acids gives a higher chance to include the best possible loop, (4) anchor groups within secondary structure elements, in particular beta-sheets are suitable, (5) amino acids with lower solvent accessibility are better anchor group. A preliminary test using a combination of the anchor group positioning criteria deduced from our analysis shows very promising results.},

  Note = {0027-8424

  Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a method to account for the shape of the potential energy curve in the evaluation of conformational free energies. The method is based on a procedure that generates a set of conformations, each with its own force-field energy, but adds a term to this energy that favors conformations that are close in structure (have a low rmsd) to other conformations. The sum of the force-field energy and rmsd-dependent term is defined here as the colony energy of a given conformation, because each conformation that is generated is viewed as representing a colony of points. The use of the colony energy tends to select conformations that are located in broad energy basins. The approach is applied to the ab initio prediction of the conformations of all of the loops in a dataset of 135 nonredundant proteins. By using an rmsd from a native criterion based on the superposition of loop stems, the average rmsd of 5-, 6-, 7-, and 8-residue long loops is 0.85, 0.92, 1.23, and 1.45 A, respectively. For 8-residue loops, 60 of 61 predictions have an rmsd of less than 3.0 A. The use of the colony energy is found to improve significantly the results obtained from the potential function alone.

  Abstract = {The conformations of loops are determined by the water-mediated interactions between amino acid residues. Energy functions that describe the interactions can be derived either from physical principles (physical-based energy function) or statistical analysis of known protein structures (knowledge-based statistical potentials). It is commonly believed that statistical potentials are appropriate for coarse-grained representation of proteins but are not as accurate as physical-based potentials when atomic resolution is required. Several recent applications of physical-based energy functions to loop selections appear to support this view. In this article, we apply a recently developed DFIRE-based statistical potential to three different loop decoy sets (RAPPER, Jacobson, and Forrest-Woolf sets). Together with a rotamer library for side-chain optimization, the performance of DFIRE-based potential in the RAPPER decoy set (385 loop targets) is comparable to that of AMBER/GBSA for short loops (two to eight residues). The DFIRE is more accurate for longer loops (9 to 12 residues). Similar trend is observed when comparing DFIRE with another physical-based OPLS/SGB-NP energy function in the large Jacobson decoy set (788 loop targets). In the Forrest-Woolf decoy set for the loops of membrane proteins, the DFIRE potential performs substantially better than the combination of the CHARMM force field with several solvation models. The results suggest that a single-term DFIRE-statistical energy function can provide an accurate loop prediction at a fraction of computing cost required for more complicate physical-based energy functions.

A range of constraint force from 1 to 25 kcal/mol.A per atom is determined to be sufficient to prevent the protein from distortion while allowing the protein to fluctuate for enhanced sampling. The protein fluctuations are essential in smoothing the effective energy surface as shown by the opening-closing of a protein hydrophobic pocket during a multiple copy energy minimization, a phenomenon that has been previously observed only in molecular dynamics. These results provide a practical guidance for applying the multiple copy techniques to molecular modeling and computer-aided drug design.},

  Abstract = {The accuracy and reliability of the recently proposed scaling-relaxation method for loop closure were examined by using extensive conformational sampling. For each of the eight heptapeptides chosen to represent a variety of protein conformations, 1,000-2,000 conformations were sampled. Each segment contained 14 rotatable backbone dihedral angles. The average root mean square deviations (RMSDs) between the predicted and the native conformations were 0.7 angstrom for the backbone and 1.2 angstroms for the side chain atoms. These predictions were substantially more accurate than the previous predictions (1.1 angstroms for the backbone and 2.2 angstroms for the side chain atoms) of the same eight protein segments based on limited conformational sampling (100 conformations for each segment). Large prediction errors mostly occurred at polar and surface side chains that are unlikely to have any meaningful conformation. Moreover, the reliability of seven of the eight predictions was demonstrated with their energy-RMSD and stability-RMSD correlations of the low-energy conformations, where the conformational stability was estimated by using the multiple copy simultaneous sampling method.},

When 7-residue loops within flexible proteins are modeled, each multicopy simulation can sample a set of loop conformations with initial dispersions up to +/- 15 degrees for backbone and +/- 30 degrees for side-chain rotatable dihedral angles. The dispersions are larger for shorter and smaller for longer and/or surface loops. The degree of convergence of loop copies during a simulation can be used to complement commonly used target functions (such as potential energy) for distinguishing between native and misfolded conformations. Furthermore, this convergence also reflects the conformational flexibility of the modeled protein segment. Application to simultaneously building all 6 hypervariable loops of an antibody is discussed.},
