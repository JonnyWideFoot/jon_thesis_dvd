As far as I know F4 is non-standard in windows for "save". I find this unintuitive (and keep hitting ctrl+s). I would preferably like a configuration switch that allows a change to ctrl+s. Maybe keyboard mappings in general could be user-customisable, with a set of common default configurations?

As far as I know, the Windows convention on text selection is that when i have selected a block of text and then hold shift and use the arrow keys, the selection should change size. This is the case in BakomaTex, however when the selection is right-to-left, the arrow keys move the left margin of the selection. This is perhaps more intuitive, but is not, standard windows practise.

The message window icon in the bottom left hand corner continues to flash red even after a problem is no longer displayed in its window. The only way to stop it flashing is to open the window and close it again. This is annoying.

Selecting a pair of `` in the WYSIWYG window only selects one of the pair in the code window, so when you press delete, only one disapears. Equally, clicking on a '' and then typing results in the text being placed in-between for the same reason.

the right-click, context menu button on the keyboard doesnt work

Its really unintuitive to have to run the install again after registration in order to remove the DEMO mode. In my opinion, DEMO should be disabled once a valid reg-key is entered, with no need to re-run setup. At the very least, this should be explained in bold print.

Pressing shift whilst the cursor is off screen results in the window scrolling. This is annoying when you wish to select a block of text larger than the visible region.

Words which break over two pages are always marked as a spelling error.

Sometimes when I press return after a paragraph in the WYSIWYG window, a ? appears in the new line.
