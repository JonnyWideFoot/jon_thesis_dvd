Minimal Energy Arrangements of Points on a Sphere
R. H. Hardin, N. J. A. Sloane and W. D. Smith
A library of arrangements of points on a sphere with (conjecturally) minimal 1/r potential.

    * How should one place n points on a sphere so as to minimize the potential energy

      Sum 1 / dist(P_i, P_j )

      This directory contains putatively optimal arrangements for n = 4, ..., 132.
